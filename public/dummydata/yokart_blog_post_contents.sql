Market Research /Competition</h2>\n<p>For entrepreneurs, analyzing the market is one of the most important things to do before starting an ecommerce business. This gives them a nice idea about their competition, market reach, and targeted user base. Ecommerce sector, in particular, has seen mushrooming of several startups catering to niche areas. This is why an initial research offers proper insight using which one can tweak their business model.</p>\n<h2>2. Contact Sellers</h2>\n<p>After creating a business model, one must reach out to sellers and garner their support. This would help you avoid the situation where you have a marketplace but no seller to sell on it. Therefore, even before launching the marketplace you must take a few sellers into confidence that they would support your website and start selling on it once it launches. You should also create a list of sellers who show interest and arrange their contact info for further contact.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommended Reading:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yo-kart.com/blog/how-to-connect-with-vendors-for-ecommerce-store/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to Connect with Vendors for Your Multivendor Ecommerce Store?</a></p>\n<h2>3. Compare and Choose the Ideal eCommerce Platform</h2>\n<p>In the current market dynamics, the most economical and feasible way to launch an online marketplace is via ecommerce platform. Therefore, the next practical step should be to compare ecommerce platforms and choose the ideal one. The best to do that is check all the online demos of these platforms from the front end, admin, dashboard, and merchant view. For example, YoKart offers an in-depth demo for all four aspects of a marketplace.

Pick the Right Pricing Package</h2>\n<p>Choosing a platform based on its feature set is one thing but one must also look at the cost input. An ecommerce platform with a long list of features that put a big hole in your pocket is not always recommended. YoKart, for example, has a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yo-kart.com/multivendor-marketplace-startup.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">startup-specific package</a>&nbsp;that offers all the required features at an economical pricing. In addition, there are other types of costs associated with running a marketplace. The biggest one of them is post-launch maintenance.

Also, ensure that you provide exactly the same information across all the social media profiles. Consider these set of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fatbit.com/fab/unique-social-media-marketing-tips-experts-increase-sale-online-store/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">unique social media tips</a>&nbsp;to increase sale of your online store shared by industries top experts.</p>\n<h2>8.

Pre-launch marketing earns much-needed popularity before the marketplace even starts operations. You can also use paid marketing for the promotion of your marketplace like Google Adwords.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>All of these points ensure that you have an online store up and running without any hassle. Although launching an ecommerce marketplace has become highly easy, thanks to ecommerce platforms like YoKart, there are certain key points to be kept in mind before launching the marketplace.

We at the individual level have to take preventive measures to curb this virus as soon as possible. Why am I saying soon is because of two reasons:\n\nIt has affected people on the global level, while writing this post the figures are 367,457 number of people affected and 16,508 number of deaths due the coronavirus (COVID-19). These numbers are likely to rise significantly higher in the coming days. \nThe increased level of uncertainty and insufficient action plan has resulted in financial market volatility which was last seen during the global financial crisis in 2008.  The virus has regrettably borne out analysts’ downside scenarios, with investors comprehending the implications of disrupted supply chains, official containment measures, and spillovers from the real economy to financial markets.\nWhile Media channels and others are discussing wildly according to the health impact. Let us step into the mind of budding entrepreneurs and address their concern about the Virus and its impact.', '<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted the world economy</strong></p>\n<p>The extent of the impact will depend on three things</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How long will it take to contain the virus</li>\n<li>Economic support government is ready to deploy</li>\n<li>Steps authorities take to contain the pandemic</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We can only take the example from China who was once the epicentre of the pandemic and has successfully curbed the impact of coronavirus as of now. The impact on Chinese economy was much more than they had expected.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Virus has now spread to Europe, South Korea, USA, Iran, and globally; where authorities are increasingly taking protective measures to contain the virus. Europe and Japan are likely already in recession territory given their weak fourth-quarter performance and high reliance on trade.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Estimates of the global impact vary: early last week, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/oecd-economic-outlook/volume-2019/issue-2_7969896b-en#page1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">predicted&nbsp;</a>that COVID-19 will lower global GDP growth by one-half a percentage point for 2020 (from 2.9 to 2.4 percent); Bloomberg Economics&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-coronavirus-pandemic-global-economic-risk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">warns&nbsp;</a>that full-year GDP growth could fall to zero in a worst-case pandemic scenario.</p>\n<h2><strong>Which Sectors Will be Affected?</strong></h2>\n<p>It is a scenario where one sector loses profit highly but some other are gaining immense popularity.</p>\n<p>The travel and tourism industry will be the hardest hit as social distancing has become mandatory and people are preferring to be indoor. Among others will be the entertainment sector, food and beverage, sporting and agriculture.</p>\n<p>There are some sectors which have faced double the amount of revenue when coronavirus has not affected the world. These sectors are: telecom, healthcare and the most promising one is the eCommerce marketplace sector.</p>\n<p>Why the e-commerce marketplace is the most promising is because it adheres to every norm that the government has announced and still empowering other local businesses which have lost its prominence due to the lockdown period.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s explain further the benefits of eCommerce sector posses in today&rsquo;s scenario:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Most countries are under lockdown or people are still not preferring to step outside their houses. Which is why, the eCommerce marketplace delivering essentials and other items to doorsteps is important.</li>\n<li>Most local and small businesses have shut down, a marketplace owner can provide opportunities to sell off their inventory.</li>\n<li>Making it a win-win situation for both customers and vendors as customers will get essential items and vendors will be able to earn money even during coronavirus.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>People who are in quarantine are sitting and spending most of their time on the internet. According to stats, internet usage has increased by 50%, entrepreneurs do not have to worry too much about their viewership.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>eCommerce Industry will bring impactful change during the Quarantine</strong></h2>\n<p>According to research, More than eight in 10 (85.6%) respondents ages 60 and older said they were likely to avoid shopping centres and malls. That&rsquo;s not surprising given that COVID-19 has hit older people the hardest, but it may have an unintended consequence on their shopping habits. Even after the virus has been contained people will still avoid going to the shopping centre to buy essential products. People are still preferring to shop online for their essential products.</p>\n<p>Luckily for some entrepreneurs, eCommerce activity related to health and grocery is still seeing a boom. Entrepreneurs are just rethinking ways to capture the demand of consumers. According to data from eCommerce ad tech provider&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pacvue.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pacvue</a>, there have been surges in Amazon searches for products like hand sanitizer and antibacterial soap. Digital shoppers are also willing to convert on products that they need with longer delivery windows in order to avoid going to stores, where inventory may be limited anyway.</p>\n<p>This scenario is providing a benefit to e-retailers like Amazon to leverage but there will be an issue in managing the supply chain which is why entrepreneurs are trying to reduce the spending on marketing.</p>\n<p>Like Amazon, other eCommerce marketplaces are gaining prominence as vendor&rsquo;s on-boarding has become easy. Many offline vendors are desperately looking to sell their products online. Leverage this industry to capture the market as the demand is high and pricing is low.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Entrepreneurs now have to focus on finding innovative approaches to their business, though there are numerous but the market is still unpredictable.</p>\n<p>Some countries will be able to control the impact of the Virus but as a preventive measure the government will still impose Social distancing for the next 4-5 months.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1101844/impact-of-coronavirus-covid-19-on-e-commerce-in-italy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.statista.com/statistics/1101844/impact-of-coronavirus-covid-19-on-e-commerce-in-italy/</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>How Entrepreneurs can use lockdown time for business growth?</strong></h2>\n<p>While the whole country is on lockdown, people are finding it hard to be productive. Business owners can use this time productively for the branding and marketing of their business. Few business owners might be scared about their survival after this pandemic but taking up this time to enhance the quality of experience you provide to your customers.</p>\n<p>Some businesses are still flourishing at double the rate, expand and widen your horizon. Move to the sector which is performing. Here are some tips on how to utilize your time during the lockdown.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Select the niche which has shown increase during the pandemic like delivery groceries and medical supplies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set Up a business which will focus on delivering commodities rather than self-pick .</li>\n<li>Spend time on choosing the right platform who has all the features to launch your eCommerce business.</li>\n<li>Do intensive market research and understand what your competitors are offering during the pandemic time.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Enhance the user experience to keep the checkout simple for people.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Change seller policies to make it easy for sellers to sell their commodities on your marketplace.</li>\n<li>Leverage the power of mobile and mobile notifications as your target audience would want to easily connect with your brand.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Yo!Kart is with You Against Covid-19</strong></h2>\n<p>We at global level are facing uncertain times due to the outbreak of COVID-19.

(3, 'For an ecommerce marketplace to become successful there are several key features that have become necessary. From mobile friendliness to secure payments, a marketplace builder must have all these features. Additionally if you are catering to a global community you need to have two key features – multi-lingual and multi-currency.', '<p>YoKart is a comprehensive&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yo-kart.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ecommerce marketplace builder</a>&nbsp;that focuses on all these features making it a powerful and complete package. The fact of the matter is that in the current market dynamics an ecommerce marketplace just cannot stay local. It has to go global and garner the power of internet to reach as much consumers as possible. This post covers some crucial points that highlight why having multilingual and multicurrency support is highly essential for an ecommerce marketplace looking at a global audience.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Benefits of Multilingual Support</strong></h2>\n<p>&ldquo;Not every country has English as their first language&rdquo; is a fact that shouldn&rsquo;t come across as news. This fact holds even more impact if you want your business to expand to a global level. And this is also where the role of multi currency support comes into play. Having an ecommerce marketplace that supports multiple languages has following benefits:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Improved User Experience</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Being able to access a website in a language of one&rsquo;s own choice improves user experience by a great deal. This is exactly why YoKart enables the marketplace owners to include the multilingual feature to their website so that their website can reach out to more and more people.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>More Credibility</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Putting your message across in a language that your target audience speaks, or giving them the option to view the website in the language they prefer shows that you think about them. It shows you are not here just for their business, but to build a good relationship. It establishes a credibility that</p>\n<p>other websites won&rsquo;t be able to match.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Global Expansion</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The more languages your ecommerce marketplace supports, the more nations you can have presence in. You will be doing your business a big favor if you include the language of the country (or the countries) you are wishing to expand to.</p>\n<p>Giving people the option to view your website in their preferred language makes them feel that you mean business. It shows you think big, and that you care about people. When people can view a website in the language they prefer, the freedom they feel keeps them engaged and hooked to your website.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Diverse User Base</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The multilingual features of YoKart enables the ecommerce marketplace owners to build a diverse user base, comprising of people from different ethnicities. This is also beneficial for increasing the customer base. When you give people the option to read what they want to read in a language they prefer, they&rsquo;d start to talk about you with their friends. And we all know that word of mouth still happens to be an amazing marketing tactic. Multilingual feature also helps you in optimizing your marketing strategies for a potential market.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Advantages of Multi Currency Feature</strong></h2>\n<p>Although US Dollar is the global currency that is accepted for trading and buying goods across the globe, we all know every country uses a different currency. Right now, UN recognizes 180 different legal tenders as currencies. Moreover, USD may be the global currency, but people still like to use a currency they are familiar with.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at some of the advantages of the multi-currency feature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Easy Accounting</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Just like every business, eCommerce marketplace owners also need to consolidate their accounts at the end of the year to see how well they did. Now, if they have different websites for different countries and currencies, keeping a tab on all of them will become really difficult. The multicurrency feature of YoKart allows marketplace owners to view the overall finances in the base currency of their choice. No matter what currency your customers use to purchase merchandise, you will get the total sales and expenditures in the currency that you selected as the base.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Improved User Experience</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you enable customers to make payment using a currency of their choice, you send out a message that you care for them. For you, it&rsquo;s not only about making money; it&rsquo;s about putting customers first and giving them a memorable user experience. Keeping this factor in mind, YoKart brings the multicurrency feature so that you can improve your website&rsquo;s traffic multifold.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>More Credibility</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>One of the fastest and most efficient methods to establish trustworthiness is to let your users use a currency of their choice. Let them make payments using the currency they are familiar with, and they&rsquo;d love to come back for more business.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Global Expansion</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you include more than one currency to help people buy things from your marketplace, it is a clear sign that you not only want to go international, but already did. While multilingual feature also works for different ethnicities living in one country, multi currency is a feature that actually gives your website the right set of wheels for global expansion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Diverse User Base</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The multicurrency feature of YoKart prepares the ecommerce marketplace owners to enter foreign ecommerce markets easily and efficiently. The multicurrency feature brings benefits for both the customers as well as the marketplace owners. Customers wouldn&rsquo;t need to convert the currency on a different site to see how much an item cost in their country would, thus speeding up the conversion funnel. The ease can, and will, give you the opportunity to expand across as many nations as you want to.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>Multilingual and multicurrency, as we discussed, are among the important factors of YoKart that can help marketplace owners engage audience from different ethnicities and locations.</p>\n<p>One important factor that you need to keep in mind as a marketplace owner is that these features are not interlinked. Changing the language should not automatically switch the currency, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>The world is always waiting for more opportunities of global expansion, and it always welcomes people who want to go big and make a difference. YoKart offers the right set of tools to help you realize your dream of becoming an international brand.</p>'),
(4, 'The future of ecommerce is unpredictable, given the fact that technology has been (and will) advancing at a lightning speed in past ten years. In the last few years, the overall equation of shopping has changed among the masses. The majority of shoppers have moved from traditional brick and mortar shopping to online shopping. This has led to mushrooming of several ecommerce startups. With valuations crossing billions of dollars, ecommerce has become one of the most talked about business models. Another aspect that has fueled the popularity of ecommerce is the continuous innovation that this sector is incorporating.', '<p>A couple of years ago, it was all about having a user engaging website while currently, it is all about mobile commerce and apps. The speed at which innovations are taking place and new technologies are coming to the forefront, many people have started to lay focus on the future of ecommerce.</p>\n<p>So now the question comes, what is the future of ecommerce technology?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Technologies That Will Rule Future Ecommerce</h2>\n<p>Deducing a future of a sector is always a tough nut to crack. You never know for certain, how the industry would shape itself. However, there are few things definite for ecommerce &ndash;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delivery times will improve</li>\n<li>Customer service will get increasingly better</li>\n<li>Product selection will become ever greater</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Various technologies that have come to forefront lately will take ecommerce to the point where things will be more improved and bigger. Let us take a closer look at those technologies</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Machine Learning</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; There was a time when a consumer used to browse through several categories of items to find the one, which they would like to buy. Nowadays, in order to increase average cart price, ecommerce websites have started to incorporate machine-learning algorithms that deduce and recommend items that the consumers could like.</p>\n<p>Machine learning is all set to revolutionize ecommerce, as we know it. By analyzing buying habits along with products often searched by the consumers&rsquo; online marketplace can give them accurate recommendations for their next purchase.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Chatbots</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; The fact of the matter is that good customer support always requires a conversation. This is why online businesses, which have a help desk to take cognizance of issues of consumers, tend to excel. However, often, one is unable to offer round the clock service, which is where Chatbots come into action. It is one of the few technologies, which will have a deep impact on business consumer engagement.</p>\n<div class=\"cta_box\">\n<div class=\"cta_title\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"cta_button\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Virtual Reality</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; First it was desktop websites, then came mobility and now it is all about virtual reality. The biggest hindrance in front of ecommerce has been that they are unable to offer the same experience like traditional shopping when it comes to visualizing the item. At max, they can offer video of the product, which also offers only 2D experience. However, with VR enabled devices, consumers an easily visualize the products in 3D offering a more immersive user experience.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Connected Devices</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; We are moving towards an era, where the devices that we use in our daily lives are getting connected. There are several companies, which have already come out with prototype devices, which would automatically analyze your requirements and place orders on your behalf. For example, a connected refrigerator would automatically analyze that you are low on milk and place an order from your preferred choice of vendor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Drones</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Delivery and logistics have been&nbsp;<strong>one of the biggest hurdles in front of ecommerce companies</strong>. However all that is about to change with robot taking charge of deliveries. Amazon has already been using a drone to deliver products to consumers. With other ecommerce companies following suit, the overall delivery game will change for the good.</p>\n<p>Keeping the above points in perspective, it won&rsquo;t be an overstatement to say that the future of ecommerce technology is going to renovate the overall scenario. Overall the scenario of ecommerce is all set to change. It is already a crowded market with new players entering the arena every now and then. This has resulted in the faster adoption of future technologies, which make the overall shopping experience of the consumer seamless.</p>\n<p>Consider this, a few years ago you used to make plans of going shopping and used to spend a whole day buying the required items. Nowadays you still spend a considerable time online going through categories of items trying to find the perfect item. However, in the near future, you could just get the item delivered without taking a step out of your bed in the least possible time.</p>'),
(5, '“We didn’t do anything wrong, but somehow we lost”, with these words Nokia CEO Stephen Elop ended his speech as the 150-year-old Finnish multinational company got acquired by Microsoft. One can imagine that if a mobile giant like Nokia failed to survive and thrive in the competitive era, how difficult it could be for startups.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by Forbes, 90 percent of startups fail. Yes, this is a hard and bleak truth. But, when it comes to reasons behind failure, different experts shared different anecdotes.', '<p>Below are not so common reasons behind startup failure that you can use to evaluate your own startup strategy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Business Model Failure (CAC and LTV Rule)</h1>\n<p>A sustainable business model is a blueprint for success. Many startups fail to clearly demonstrate the following:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How they will create value?</li>\n<li>What problem are they solving and for whom?</li>\n<li>How the business will stay competitive and of course resilience to change</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With a vague business model, startups are unable to understand the ecosystem they are operating in and how technology will impact their business.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Example</h2>\n<p>A Boston-based startup, Riot Vine, was founded in 2009 by Kabir Hemrajani. Unfortunately, the company dissolved in 2010 and the reason is absence of a business model.</p>\n<p>Kabir, himself gave an interview to a local publication in which he said, &ldquo;We spent three months head down developing Riot Vine without a business model. I think I didn&rsquo;t realize what we were building at the beginning. Riot Vine is closing. I genuinely want to thank everyone who signed up, posted an event, or used Riot Vine to discover what was happening around town.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The Right Approach</h2>\n<p>In the above example, we have seen that a startup was trying to establish itself without a business model. On the other hand, there is a market mantra around which a business model should be developed &ndash; Cost of acquiring the customer (CAC) must be less than the lifetime value of that customer (LTV).</p>\n<p>Acquiring customers takes money, resource and time. The best tricks to gain your customers for a lifetime are:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Know your ideal customers</li>\n<li>Invest in customer retention</li>\n<li>Reduce customer attenuation</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An American multinational computer software company, Adobe, saved its business through subscription revenue which significantly improves LTV.</p>\n<p>The company offered Photoshop for $9.99 USD per month. This amount is 100X less than the cost of the perpetual license but Adobe now has two benefits:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>More number of customers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As price is less, more people will go for Photoshop.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lifetime customers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With $9.99 USD per month, customers stay with the company for a lifetime.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Wrong MVP</h1>\n<p>Minimum Viable Product (MVP) allows an entrepreneur to test his idea by exhibiting an early release of the product to target audience. The next step is to collect customer&rsquo;s feedback and make necessary changes.</p>\n<p>MVP is more like a risk reduction tool as it gathers feedback about the product and avoids the possibility of wasting time and money. Many startups fail because they focus on building the product while minimizing their contact with target audience. In simple words, they don&rsquo;t implement the MVP concept.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Example</h2>\n<p>A startup named, Devver, failed because &ldquo;they made a mistake of focusing on engineering first and customer development second.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ben, founder of Devver, said, &ldquo;We should have asked, is there an even simpler version of this product that we can deliver sooner to learn more about pricing, market size, and technical challenges? We should have focused more on customer development and finding a MVP.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The Right Approach</h2>\n<p>While creating a MVP, one should find out the right balance between maximum value and minimum design. Few but most important functions are added during the MVP phase. MVP gives the required data that confirms the interest of users in a product. Steps that should be kept in mind during the development of MVP:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep the product quality high with only few important features</li>\n<li>Track user behavior</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t think about the overall sustainability of a product</li>\n<li>Study the competition deeply</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of a company that started as MVP:</p>\n<p>In 2004, MySpace was the most popular social network. But then, Mark Zuckerberg entered Harvard University with the basic model of his product, Facebook. The MVP had only those features that would ensure its success.</p>\n<p>After its incredible triumph, the students at University of Columbia, Yale, and Stanford started using it. Students, who used MVP, gave Mark the essential feedback that he later used to improve the product.</p>\n<div class=\"cta_box\">\n<div class=\"cta_title\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"cta_button\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<h1>Problem with MMP</h1>\n<p>Minimum Marketable Product (MMP) &ndash; The most basic product that dwells on user experience. MMP addresses requirements of a user, with the correct level of UI that can be sold and marketed successfully. Many companies failed as they targeted the wrong market segment and envisioned the wrong product or features.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Example</h2>\n<p>In 1957, the American multinational automaker, Ford, manufactured Edsel which was considered as an automobile marque. The company invested heavily in this car but Americans wanted smaller and more economic vehicles at that time.</p>\n<p>Thus, Edsel never gained popularity.</p>\n<p>On November 19, 1959, Ford announced the end of the Edsel program and the company lost $350 million or the equivalent of $2.3 billion in 2016.</p>\n<p>According to the Associated Content &ndash; &ldquo;Pundits have blamed its failure on Ford Motors execs, who never really defined the model&rsquo;s niche in the car market. The pricing and market aim, of most Edsel models, were somewhere between the high-end Ford and the lowest-end Mercury.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ford had absolutely no idea that the failure was going to happen until after the vehicles had been designed and built.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The Right Approach</h2>\n<p>Under MMP, it&rsquo;s all about creating a product for minimum number of people with the minimum number of features.</p>\n<p>Many startups try to develop over-engineered products with lots of features that provide little or almost no value to users. The concept of MMP helps to focus on what really matters.</p>\n<p>Take an example of original iPhone that was launched in 2007. Apple selected a narrow set of customers for its product. iPhone had less number of features than its competitors. But these limitations did not hinder its success. The public reaction to the launch of the iPhone resulted in media calling it as &ldquo;Jesus phone&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Experts believe that the staggering success of iPhone is because the company focused on those features that made difference to users and developed a product for specific target audience.</p>\n<h1>Founders&rsquo; Ego and Power Struggle</h1>\n<p>Founders fail because they can&rsquo;t admit that they are wrong. They want to be seen as the smartest person in the company. They get stuck in their egos. Ego can actually be fatal for a startup. Ego is self-admiration and it prevents a founder from seizing innovative and beneficial opportunities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Example</h2>\n<p>GovWorks was founded in 1998 by two childhood friends. It was built to help government clients keep track of their contracts and citizens can apply for jobs and book tickets.</p>\n<p>The company experienced an initial success but due to a power struggle between founders, personal ego and disagreements within management, it was sold in 2001.</p>\n<p>An award winning documentary was made on GovWorks&rsquo; demise i.e. &ldquo;Statup.com.&rdquo; The bottom line was, &ldquo;when working with friends: egos need not apply.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The Right Approach</h2>\n<p>Founders usually stick with their original idea even if it doesn&rsquo;t work. They should learn to pivot whenever needed. However, pivoting should only be considered when absolutely necessary. There are many companies that pivoted and experienced massive success.</p>\n<h1>How to pivot?</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Pick up new goals</li>\n<li>Listen to your customers (what they want)</li>\n<li>Align goals with your vision</li>\n<li>Adopt features or changes whenever needed</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A brand that pivoted successfully is YouTube, an American video sharing website. It started as a video-based dating service where people introduced themselves and recorded what they were looking for.</p>\n<p>This concept didn&rsquo;t work and the founders decided to open it up for any video. It pivoted slowly and grew into a video empire.</p>\n<p>Other reasons such as lack of passion, pricing of products, intra-team conflict, poor marketing strategies, and no or bad after sales service lead to startup failure.</p>\n<div class=\"cta_box\">\n<div class=\"cta_title\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"cta_button\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<p>In this vibrant ecosystem, it&rsquo;s important to understand and appreciate the reason behind failure of startups. Don&rsquo;t get demotivated by seeing what happened with others, instead follow your heart and write your own story of success.</p>'),

(7, 'Where should the early stage ecommerce startups focus, in the first year of their inception?', '<p>Where should the early stage ecommerce startups focus, in the first year of their inception?</p>\n<p>This is the question that engulfs every ecommerce entrepreneur&rsquo;s mind. And rightly so, because focusing on the most important part of business projection can make or break the deal for the business owners. While some business analysts say brand awareness is the area of concern, others say it&rsquo;s the direct marketing that takes precedence.</p>\n<p>But before we proceed with the age old debate, let&rsquo;s see what these two marketing strategies mean.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Brand Marketing</strong></h2>\n<p>The focus of brand marketing is towards building awareness. It&rsquo;s about announcing that your ecommerce venture is up and running and telling people what it does, with a whole lot of zing.</p>\n<p>Brand marketing is eloquent, creative, hoity-toity and attention grabbing. It&rsquo;s a bird, it&rsquo;s a plane, it&rsquo;s Superman! Get it?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Direct Marketing</strong></h2>\n<p>You know Oppo, the popular smartphone brand that also happens to be an official partner of FC Barcelona, invests a lot of money or branding. However, OnePlus, which also happens to be a subsidiary of Oppo, didn&rsquo;t spend a lot on branding. Rather, they make their product, tell people what it is capable of, and that&rsquo;s it. The very first model, OnePlus One sold like hot cakes among smartphone aficionados.</p>\n<p>You see, direct marketing is about directly telling people what your business is about and giving them the option to do business with you right away.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>As an Early Stage Ecommerce Startup, Your Primary Focus Should Be To Create Demand or Tap Into Demand. Brand Marketing Can Wait</strong></h2>\n<p>Your primary focus is sales, and brand marketing can do it. But it will take a long time, and being at an early stage, time is the most important element you have. Let&rsquo;s take a look at some of the limitations of Brand Marketing:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Costly and Difficult:</strong>&nbsp;First things first, creating brand awareness for an ecommerce business is not an easy task, and it&rsquo;s not at all affordable, at least for early age startups. Many companies have spent millions of dollars on branding, and as a startup, we recommend you to steer clear of spending such a hefty amount, if you have such a hefty amount. And if you do, save it for rainy day, or keep saving it for branding in future. But not now.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>No Way To Measure ROI:</strong>&nbsp;New ecommerce startups need to know how much return they are getting on their investments, especially marketing efforts. Brand marketing doesn&rsquo;t show you the return, so you can&rsquo;t measure how efficient it has been for you. So it would be better for new entrepreneurs to focus on marketing channels that they can measure for efficacy.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>No Immediate Cash:</strong>&nbsp;That sounds like a deal-breaker, doesn&rsquo;t it? A new company needs consistent cash flow to keep the operations intact. A slight jolt in cash flow can lead to the butterfly effect. For an ecommerce startup, cash flow is really important to keep the payments flowing, both inward and outward. You don&rsquo;t want the flow to stop, so for the time being, brand marketing should not be your focus. Branding doesn&rsquo;t encourage buying, neither does it offer anything; it simply tells people who you are and what you do.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>And these are the issues that direct marketing can easily resolve for you</strong></h2>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a difference between brand and brand marketing. Remember we talked about Oppo and OnePlus in the beginning? There are many brands that didn&rsquo;t have to spend a lot of money on advertising. Their products were so amazing that people talked about it all the time, and created a niche for it.</p>\n<p>Just ask yourself this question: who would you trust more, a company that says it&rsquo;s good, or a genuine end user who says the company is good? Good brands often have their customers sell for them,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yo-kart.com/blog/make-customers-the-biggest-salespersons-for-your-ecommerce-store/\">word of mouth</a>, that&rsquo;s the word.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s see how direct marketing makes things easy and efficient for new ecommerce entrepreneurs:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It Works</strong>: Sounds too direct to be true? Well, that&rsquo;s exactly why direct marketing is good, because it works, it sells. Because when you are selling directly, you are either creating demand, or tapping it (we talked about it, remember?). Remember the good old &ldquo;sell me this pen&rdquo;? You can create a need for it, or you can entice your audience enough to interest them into buying the pen.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Measurable:</strong>&nbsp;When you invest your money in AdWords for direct marketing, you know how much you invested, and you&rsquo;ll be able to measure the outcome with the number of clicks you got, the purchases made, and the revenue generated. Campaigns give a return on investment, sooner or later, high or low, and they are always measurable.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Cash:&nbsp;</strong>Direct marketing means measurable results, and measurable results also include revenue generated from a campaign. It means there&rsquo;s some cash received, if not plenty.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>As Han Seoul said, &ldquo;50% of something is better than 100% of nothing&rdquo;, direct marketing gives you measurable results, better selling opportunity.&nbsp; These benefits are available in brand marketing, at least not in a short span of time, and neither are the efforts measurable. Don&rsquo;t spend too much time in branding in the beginning, focus on sales, because sales will keep you on your feet. No matter how many people know about your business, if they ain&rsquo;t buying, you ain&rsquo;t earning.</p>'),

Their hold over the market is so strong, that it leaves almost negligible chances for entrepreneurs, who are just starting out, to establish their own ecommerce business.</p>\n<p>Having deep pockets, the big players prefer aggressive marketing for their well-established business to drive away the competition. Such a competitive business environment makes it extremely difficult for new ecommerce ventures to survive.</p>\n<p>However, working on niche business ideas can help entrepreneurs start small and survive the competition. After careful analysis of various emerging/successful business models, we have compiled the following list for individuals and entrepreneurs; it will help you find a niche market to start your new venture.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Health and Fitness Products</h2>\n<p>According to Statista, the global health and fitness club industry is worth more than $80 billion. Entrepreneurs, who are passionate to promote a healthy lifestyle, should look at this niche market to venture in.</p>\n<p>Products like powdered protein and other health supplements have a huge demand worldwide. By partnering with sellers who provide such products you can easily establish your niche market and make good deal of profits. Furthermore, fitness products like barbells, dumbbells, etc., can also be sold on such marketplace.</p>\n<p>How to make a health and fitness ecommerce website successful?</p>\n<p>Most established ecommerce marketplaces like Amazon sell health and fitness products but they fail to sell those products, which don&rsquo;t enjoy a good demand. To be different, try to gain market share by providing the complete range.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Eco-Friendly Products</h2>\n<p>Nearly 89% people prefer buying at least one product that has a positive impact on the environment. Furthermore, with global warming becoming a threat to the environment, starting an online marketplace to sell environmental-friendly products makes more sense. Under this niche, there are several product ideas that can make more profits. Examples &ndash; easy to deploy solar kits, biodegradable waste bags, etc.</p>\n<p>How to stand out with an ecommerce portal offering eco-friendly products</p>\n<p>Depending on your area of operation, you can partner with businesses to help sell eco-friendly products. Example &ndash; By partnering with real estate companies in your areas or individual home owners, you can help them save electricity bill by utilizing solar power.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Organic Clothing</h2>\n<p>As more people become aware of benefits of eco-friendly lifestyle, shifts in the clothing industry towards environment-friendly fashion are clearly visible. Earlier, eco-friendly clothing was dominated by the rich, but as ecommerce levels the playfield, more businesses are trying to enter this niche market. You can also fulfill your entrepreneurial dream while making the planet a better place to live.</p>\n<p>Why opening an organic clothing website is the right thing to do?</p>\n<p>Not all ecommerce players sell organic clothing. This can be an opportunity for you if you want to start your own online venture in this space. To keep high-profit margins, you can target a specific audience segment and offer luxury goods.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Specialized Industrial Machinery Parts</h2>\n<p>No general-purpose ecommerce store will sell specialized/custom machinery parts for industrial usage due to less demand. This creates a gap between industries (that involve the use of complex machinery) and sellers, who sell spare parts of the machinery. Due to lack of availability of such parts, business owners are often left with no option other than to buy the spare parts from the first seller they come across.</p>\n<p>Why you should start an ecommerce website for selling industrial machinery parts?</p>\n<p>Businesses go through financial losses when their machines stop working and production comes to a halt. To help such business run their operations at optimal speed, you can provide them spare parts on-demand by custom building the part.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Furniture Marketplace</h2>\n<p>Due to the large size of furniture, only select online marketplaces list furnishing products on their website and that too with delivery option available only for few cities. This leaves a window of opportunity open for entrepreneurs, who wish to start their own furniture marketplace and earn huge profits. To start with, you can partner with local furniture makers and list their creations on your website.</p>\n<p>Furniture has untapped market space but you&rsquo;ve got to be different from other ecommerce marketplaces to capture it.</p>\n<p>People prefer to look at furniture from each angle and see how it will fit in their room. To solve this problem, it is recommended to hire a professional photographer or use advanced technology that can enable buyers preview the furniture through a mobile app placed right in their room.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>As most entrepreneurs and ecommerce experts may describe it, the first few steps are the hardest for anyone setting out on their startup journey. Adding more to problems, severe competition makes it even more difficult for one to survive in today&rsquo;s market. To stay on the safe side, starting a niche online business can be a dependable solution. The above mentioned niche ecommerce business ideas face less competition as of now and pose &nbsp;perfect state for zealous individuals who plan to create an ecommerce marketplace in the near future.</p>'),

What you can do is use a certain combination of customer analytics to understand their behavioral intent and turn the clicks into sales.</p>\n<p>By collecting customer data pertaining to what they search, where they click, and where they leave, you can plug the holes and ensure an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yo-kart.com/blog/tips-to-increase-the-average-order-value-aov-of-your-ecommerce-marketplace/\">increase in average order value</a>&nbsp;and conversions. Let&rsquo;s discuss how to make it happen.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Identify troubled pages &amp; discover why they are leaving</strong></h2>\n<p>Quite often ecommerce websites have an issue where they are getting a substantial number of visitors, but those visitors are not converting to customers. This means even though you are getting attention, you are not getting any business. In order to find the source of this issue, you need to look at exit rate of your pages.</p>\n<p>Pages that have high exit rate highlight a leak from where visitors decided not to go ahead with the purchase. It can be product page, shipping details page, or even product search result. In any case, to find out why they left, you need to first ascertain from where they left.</p>\n<p>Google Analytics is one such tool that offers good insight into identifying which pages have highest exit rates. Study the pages that have high exit rate, use the heat map feature to discover what might have trigger them to leave, identify the problems, and fix them.</p>\n<p>For instance, you are a sales representative of a clothing store and you see a customer walking out of the door without buying anything. Your first instinct is to walk up to the customer and find out why they are leaving. You then assist them by offering whatever they need, hence completing a sale.</p>\n<p>The same strategy is required for your ecommerce website. This is where Exit Surveys come into picture to target potential customers at the right moment. The Exit Survey appears as a popup when the user is about to leave a page. Ideally, an Exit Survey asks customers the reason why they are leaving or to share a feedback. You can use that data to improve the user experience of your website and ensure that future customers do not walk away for the same reasons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Analyze Traffic Sources for better customer targeting</strong></h2>\n<p>One of the key aspects of any ecommerce website is the source of its traffic (from where a visitor ended up on your website). Overall there are two types of traffic:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Organic traffic (which comes through search results)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Referral traffic (which comes through links shared on social media, blogs, discussion forums, ads, etc.)<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Consider the following scenario, a person &ldquo;X&rdquo; searches &ldquo;men&rsquo;s black leather shoes&rdquo; and finds your online store in the results. He comes to your website, without knowing anything other than what is displayed on the store. Another user &ldquo;Y&rdquo; reads a review for &ldquo;the most rugged and comfortable leather shoes ever&rdquo; and clicks on the referral link, which takes him to your website. This time the customer knows beforehand that your shoes have a reputation for being rugged and comfortable.</p>\n<p>While the former user comes from a pool or organic traffic, the latter comes from referral traffic. Both these users come to your website with a different context. You need to analyze both these traffic sources differently and optimize them in order to convert their respective traffic into customers.</p>\n<p>You can use a lead generation tool or a targeting tool to trigger a survey or a popup based on the query of the user. For example, if a user comes from an organic traffic source, looking for &ldquo;Bluetooth headphones&rdquo;, you can use a lead generation tool and incentivize them to buy your product if they signup. This will not only drive them towards making an immediate purchase but also give you a registered customer.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if a user comes to your website after clicking on a referral link of &ldquo;best headphones for audiophile&rdquo;, you can just trigger a discount for all users referred through that link, which gives you better leverage at conversion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Leverage upon abandoned shopping carts</strong></h2>\n<p>Studies have shown more than 68% of all online ecommerce visitors abandon their shopping cart, which collectively amounts to $4 trillion. What is interesting to know is that almost 66% of these shopping carts are recoverable, which represent a huge opportunity.</p>\n<p>Using customer data, one can easily minimize&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yo-kart.com/blog/shopping-cart-abandonment-reasons-and-how-to-counter-them/\">shopping cart abandonment</a>, because if a person puts a product into their shopping cart, he definitely has a desire to buy it. But if he abandons it, that means something triggered him to do so &ndash; such as shipping cost, second thoughts, or better price somewhere else.</p>\n<p>A good practice in such a scenario is to use exit notification on critical pages (cart &amp; checkout) that triggers whenever a user tries to leave the page or moves the cursor to the close button. Using this exit notification you can either ask the user what they did not like or just offer some incentives to encourage them to make the purchase.</p>\n<p>Another way to recover abandoned carts is to send out email notifications to users generally 24-48 after they have abandoned the cart as a reminder to complete the sale. You can use the number of purchases made by a particular user in the past as criteria to determine the discount to be offered to them for completing the purchase.</p>\n<div class=\"cta_box\">\n<div class=\"cta_title\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"cta_button\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion (Act as a helping hand to your customer)</strong></h2>\n<p>If a customer wants to buy a product, he will eventually buy it, whether on your website or your competitor&rsquo;s. To ensure that customers don&rsquo;t trickle out once visiting your website, you need to deeply study their purchasing &amp; browsing behavior. And that&rsquo;s where customer data holds the key to the next frontier by enabling ecommerce marketplace more efficient in converting users.</p>\n<p>Many ecommerce marketplaces are already tinkering with AI and big data to target consumers more effectively and enjoying increased profit margins. By and large, consumer data is all about understanding what potential customers want and then creating an environment that leads them to make the purchase.</p>'),

And for those already running a standard business, it&rsquo;s time to future-proof your business against the advancement of the internet with a fully-functional e-commerce website.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Why Traditional Commerce Retailers should Embrace Ecommerce?</strong></h2>\n<p>With technological advancements, the shopping trends among the customers have radically transformed over the past few years. Also, the soaring popularity&nbsp;of online shopping has completely integrated into our lives and imagining a day without it seems to be a daunting task. As per&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Statista</a>, there has been a tremendous rise in the sales of e-commerce websites every year. With a whopping amount of $2.8 billion in the last year, retail e-commerce sales are expected to reach $4.88 billion by 2021.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With a huge impact of digital transformation over the commerce sector, people are more likely to purchase a product online rather than going to a physical store. Want to start your e-commerce business but waiting for the right time? There&rsquo;s no ideal time to start an online store. Yes, you heard it right! Because it&rsquo;s the ideation that transforms your business to the next level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>What are the Benefits of E-commerce over Traditional Commerce?</strong></h2>\n<p>By enabling the customer to make a particular purchase in just a few clicks, an e-commerce website is an effective and affordable option that empowers you to augment your business. Let&rsquo;s dive deeper into the advantages of using e-commerce websites over traditional commerce.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>1) No geographical limitation</strong><strong><br /></strong></h3>\n<p>When it comes to traditional commerce, you can only do business where you have set up your physical store. This is not the case with E-commerce websites. For them, the whole world is their playground if planned strategically. People from one corner of the world can easily order a specific product from another corner of the world with a few clicks.</p>\n<h3><strong>2)</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Easy way to gain customer by search engine visibility</strong></h3>\n<p>Traditional commerce shops depend mostly on branding and relations to drive more customers to their shop but on the other hand, e-commerce drive most of its traffic from search engines. Over 30% of e-commerce traffic comes from organic searches on search engines. This is just the traffic from organic searches and then we have advertisements, social media traffic which is the tipping point for many e-commerce businesses. By using an innovative solution like Yo!Kart for your e-commerce store, you can easily gather insights into the traffic coming from different social media platforms.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>3)</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Lower cost/investment</strong></h3>\n<p>One of the best reasons to open an e-commerce website is because it requires a low investment as compared to a physical store. To cut down the prices for your e-commerce website, you can make&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yo-kart.com/blog/brand-marketing-vs-direct-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">use of the best marketing strategy</a>&nbsp;involving: organic search, pay per click or social media traffic. Also, the manpower and property required to get the business up and running is much less as compared to a physical store.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>4)</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Locate product quickly</strong></h3>\n<p>We have all been through the hassle of locating a specific product in a huge store, running up and down the aisles and asking the person in charge to assist you. This is not the case with e-commerce platforms, as the customer just has to click through intuitive navigation or just type the specific product in the search box to immediately find their requirement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>5)</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Save travel time and cost</strong></h3>\n<p>The main reason for people shifting from traditional commerce to e-commerce is because it saves travel time and cost. For a physical shop, the customer has to visit the outlet to purchase the item whereas for an e-commerce website he can just do it with few clicks sitting on the couch. With the advent of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yo-kart.com/mobile-commerce.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">m-commerce</a>, it has, even more, saved the time of the customer by allowing them to purchase the products on the go.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>6)</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Enables deal, bargain, coupons and group buying</strong></h3>\n<p>Many of you would think that even traditional commerce offers deals, bargains, etc. But e-commerce website makes it more convenient and easy for customers to avail them. Imagine a situation where you have coupons for groceries in one store and discount voucher for clothing in a completely different store. Imagine the amount of hassle you would have to face to buy both these products. While in the case of online shopping, you can purchase anything with just a few clicks and avail both the coupon and discount voucher on the same platform.<br /><br />By using our e-commerce solution Yo!Kart, you can effortlessly generate a detailed report of the discount coupons availed by the customers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>7)</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Abundance of information</strong></h3>\n<p>When you go to a shopping store, the only information you see is that written on the product and the price of the product. In an e-commerce store, additional information is easily available to the customer in just a click. Mostly this information is entered into the system by individual vendors which require no extra effort or cost of the e-commerce owner.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>8)</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Remains open all the time</strong></h3>\n<p>Another major factor why the customer has shifted from traditional commerce to e-commerce websites is that they can shop at odd timings too. E-commerce store timings are 24*7*365. An e-commerce website has no obligation which is why they can remain open all the time. The sellers benefit from it as they gain more and more orders and for the customer, around the clock store is much more convenient.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>9)</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Create e-commerce store for niche product</strong></h3>\n<p>There are often niche products which are difficult to find in the physical world. Some things do not have a market in the physical world or even if they have, it&rsquo;s very scarce. In the online sphere, all you have to do is type the specific product in a search engine and you will find a list of websites that sell the product. For instance: Spare parts of the equipment are very hard to find in the physical world but comparatively easier in the online world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>10)</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Creates targeted communication</strong></h3>\n<p>To create a targeted communication, the only thing you require is the email address and personal information/ habits of the potential customer. To gather this information, creating a registration page and enabling cookies on your website is important. Once you get a hold of the habits of the customers, you can send across relevant messages. This information also helps in recommending products on the e-commerce website. Some e-commerce websites also send emails with products you may like to buy.<br /><br />By leveraging the smart recommendations in the Yo!Kart, you can easily recommend products to your users based on the system weightage and send them personalized emails too.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>11)</strong>&nbsp;<strong>What is the Right way for Traditional Retailer to Move to Digital?</strong></h3>\n<p>With an aim to stay competitive and achieve unparalleled growth, many businesses are migrating to the world of e-commerce from their conventional methods of selling. While online retail is growing at a massive rate nowadays, moving to digital commerce is a great idea irrespective of your business sector. To offer exceptional convenience to the customers and empower your brand, here is a checklist that you need to consider before moving to e-commerce.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Start with the Groundwork</strong></li>\n<li><strong><br />The first step includes creating an effective strategic plan for your business. Based on the processes, competencies, and the area of services of your business, you can build an efficient strategy tailored to match your business requirements. Secondly, prioritizing your customer base can help you focus on a targeted market.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Analyzing Customer Behavior</strong></li>\n<li><strong><br />Another crucial step is understanding the user behavior and their requirements from your business. By getting insights into the shopping patterns of the customers, you can easily position your products and services accordingly.&nbsp;This enables you to provide a personalized experience to your customers which further helps to empower your business.&nbsp;</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Setting Up A Store</strong></li>\n<li><strong><br />Once you finalize the strategic goals, select a niche product idea, analyze the target audience, and develop an in-depth understanding of the customer expectations, you are ready to set up an online store for your business. However, to run this digital store successfully, you need to create a merchant account. Also, you need to create a database (with an intuitive and user-friendly interface) that can help you organize the products on your e-commerce website in an effective manner.&nbsp;</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Social Media</strong></li>\n<li><strong><br /></strong>Leveraging the power of social media to create a unique and vigorous experience among the users.

Read along…', '<p>Crafting a logo for a business is a task that brings ample amount of excitement and challenges. It all begins with understanding the importance of the logo, and that&rsquo;s exactly when it hits us, creating a logo is not remotely close to easy. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether a logo in question is going to be a new one or a revision/update of an old one, doing it right the first time is as difficult as doing it right the second time. But in the end, it all boils down to this: every business needs a&nbsp;logo&nbsp;that echoes their brand and also tells the tone and personality of the company.</p>\n<p>Logos mark such a strong presence that kids who haven&rsquo;t learned to read and write, know which logo means ice cream and which one is for their favorite toy. As an ecommerce marketplace owner, this is the presence you want to have among your audience. And for that, you need a logo that speaks for you. When it comes to&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://www.yo-kart.com/blog/brand-marketing-vs-direct-marketing/\">direct marketing vs brand marketing</a></strong>, branding always performs better. In this post, we are going to reveal the guide to branding as well as the secrets of creating a logo that takes your game to the next level. Read along&hellip;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>1.The Logo Should Resonate With Your Business</strong></h2>\n<p>This is the prerequisite while planning a logo for your business. The basic idea is to make sure the logo carries the message you want to portray, clearly and subtly. See how brilliantly Amazon tells they sell almost everything on their marketplace, or how FedEx has an arrow in the negative space between the E and x. These small innovative ideas tell a lot about the company. Know what you want to say, integrate the message in the design of your logo, and you&rsquo;ve got a winner.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>2. Simplicity Is the Key</strong></h2>\n<p>It&rsquo;s of prime importance that the logo you create for your ecommerce marketplace is easy to identify and remember. While it&rsquo;s our natural tendency to add a lot of details to a logo, it is the simple and minimalistic design that gets engraved in audience&rsquo;s mind easily and quickly. Simple logos are catchy, and their image easily sets in the mind at the first glance, so stick to a simple design.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>3. Don&rsquo;t Lose Patience</strong></h2>\n<p>This particular point is of high importance as it determines the fate of a logo. Many times, people have faced a tough time in figuring out a logo, and in their struggle, they decided to &ldquo;just go with this one&rdquo;. Don&rsquo;t fall in this pit. A logo sits at the core of the business, and a wrong choice can mar your brand image before you can say blueberry pie. Do not settle; take your time to find the right one.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>4. Keep Logo Type in Consideration at All Times</strong></h2>\n<p>The type of logo you want for your ecommerce also depends on how you want it to be. Ray-Ban and Coca-Cola are brands with a Wordmark logo, while Nike, Shell, Volkswagen, etc. have symbolic logos. Amazon has done a brilliant job by choosing to go for the &ldquo;a&rdquo; with the famous &ldquo;A to Z&rdquo; smiling arrow. When it comes to ecommerce marketplaces, it&rsquo;s all about using the right color kind of logo to instigate the desire to log in and buy something.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>5. Do Not Compromise on Originality</strong></p>\n<p>We have always inclined towards a brand, and we have a special admiration for its logo. Sometimes, we are so much in love with a particular brand that we find it hard not to follow their footsteps. It all sounds fair; after all, imitation is the best form of flattery. But doing so in case of copyrighted material can land you and your business in a soup. Originality is not only a legal requirement but also important for credibility. &ldquo;Oh, the one that looks like Amazon&rsquo;s?&rdquo; would be a memory recall not good for your brand image. Additionally originality does always results in&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://www.yo-kart.com/blog/how-to-ensure-substantial-roi-from-your-ecommerce-business/\">substantial ROI for an ecommerce business</a></strong>. Your business idea may not be original, but that shouldn&rsquo;t stop you with building a completely original company, one which has completely unique presence.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>6. It Should Stand The Test of Time</strong></h2>\n<p>Some companies change their brand logo because they&rsquo;ve been in business for a long time and the logo needs a refreshing touch. For newcomers and people who haven&rsquo;t had a company logo yet, need to make sure they don&rsquo;t need to iterate their logo designing process too often. So you need to make sure the design of your company&rsquo;s logo adds value to your business for a long time, without needing regular editing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>7. It Must Be Scalable and Versatile</strong></h2>\n<p>Versatility of a logo pertains to its aesthetics and integrity across various display channels. From web to print to mobile websites, the logo should deliver a consistent user experience to your audience. Anything less than that won&rsquo;t be good enough to let you achieve an overall presence and prominence. Scalability pertains to the size of the logo. It should be legible look great, no matter the size. It&rsquo;s important because different media will need a different logo size. Expanding it or contracting it shouldn&rsquo;t interfere with readability and user experience.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>8. Understand the Impact of Colors</strong></h2>\n<p>Colors have a lasting impact on viewers. There is an entire branch of psychology dedicated to the effect of colors on branding. Here&rsquo;s a hint: Red is associated with hunger, Orange with confidence, warmth, energy and friendliness, Yellow to grab attention, Purple with royalty, luxury, beauty, spirituality and wisdom, and so on. Make sure the color you choose is in sync with the nature of your business.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>9. Don&rsquo;t Lose Patience</strong></h2>\n<p>Nope, this one is not writing or proofreading mistake. The Don&rsquo;t Lose Patience up there is about deciding a logo. This one is about the wait to let the logo do its work. Making an impact on people does not happen overnight. Everything takes its time, has its own course. Yes, digital marketing is an effective way to propagate awareness among masses, but trust, brand value and logo identification will come in its due course of time. Don&rsquo;t lose patience; let the logo do its work.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>Logos have been around us so much that we don&rsquo;t need to give much of a thought to know which one belongs to what company. The ease with which we associate with them has made us take logos for granted. The game changes when it comes to finding the right logo for our own business. That&rsquo;s when we get to realize how difficult it is to find the one right logo. The secrets we revealed above will be helpful in paving your road to the perfect logo. This is going to be a creative journey, so remember to have a plenty of fun, too!</p>'),

Many marketplaces emerged, and with time, increased their user base by doling out fat discounts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As the world of eCommerce evolved, so did the business strategies. From customer acquisition, now, most of the internet marketplaces are focusing more on increasing sales instead of just gathering more consumers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The best way to do this is to recommend additional products and inspire the customers to see what you are offering them. This way you will not only&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yo-kart.com/blog/tips-to-increase-the-average-order-value-aov-of-your-ecommerce-marketplace/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">increase your average order value</a>&nbsp;but also increase sales. Through dynamic product recommendation, you can start moving up on the sales ladder.</p>\n<p>To give the uninitiated an idea of what Dynamic Product Recommendation looks like, let&rsquo;s take an example of a new customer. When a new customer makes an account with a particular marketplace, they see &ldquo;most popular items&rdquo; as recommendations. This is because there are no cookies and no algorithm to identify what the user may like. As the new customer starts buying things, they start seeing recommendations as &ldquo;things you may like&rdquo;. But that comes later.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s see how dynamic product recommendation can help you increase your sales.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>1.It gives you an opportunity to upsell</strong></h2>\n<p>Upselling gives you an opportunity to sell a higher value version of something as compared to what the customer is planning to buy. What marketplace owners need to focus here is to recommend products that are within a reasonable reach while upselling. If done right, upselling is a great way to increase sales.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>What&rsquo;s happening here</strong>:&nbsp;</em>Suppose a customer wants to buy a laptop under $300. So, while listing the results, you can recommend a laptop worth $339. If you go above $350, the recommendation may go unnoticed, and in case it goes beyond reasonable limits (say, a laptop worth $500), the customer may feel forced.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Offering a better option to your potential customer not only gives you the opportunity to pitch a higher priced item and increase revenue but also build trust.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>2.It gives you the opportunity to cross-sell</strong></h2>\n<p>The basic idea here is to increase the cart value instead of increasing the product value. Here, dynamic product recommendation can help you suggest items that are closely related to the item a customer has added to cart.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>What&rsquo;s happening here</strong>:&nbsp;</em>Suppose a customer wants to buy a DSLR camera. Based on various parameters (like cost, make and model), you can fine tune your recommendation section so that the potential customer gets to choose different things that he may need with the item selection. Let&rsquo;s see what all a person needs with a DSLR: A bigger lens, a bag, a memory card, lens cleaner, and maybe, just maybe, a tripod.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>3.Speeds up the checkout funnel</strong></h2>\n<p>This is where the role of artificial intelligence and big data comes into play. Given the massive range of products that go with a particular item, choosing the one that this particular customer needs can become time-consuming, and it can delay the sales time. The faster a customer moves through the checkout funnel, the better it is for the business.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So, marketplace owners should use customer data and see what combinations were bought the most, &ldquo;club&rdquo; those items together with the camera and present it as a bundle package at a better rate.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>What&rsquo;s happening here</strong>:</em>&nbsp;Using the above example of DSLR purchase, you can bundle a couple of items together (camera bag, memory card and cleaning brush/card reader/tripod and so forth) to help customers purchase related items quickly and move to check out as early as possible.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>4.Comparison</strong></h2>\n<p>It&rsquo;s natural for the customer to scroll down one last time to see other options before finally going to the cart or the checkout page. This is also the time when you can try upselling once again. Yes, the consumer may have made up his mind, but if you don&rsquo;t try, you will miss the opportunity altogether.</p>\n<p>The power of comparison works both ways. If they buy the higher version, you got a better sale; if they don&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;ve already decided their purchase and would like to go ahead with it. There&rsquo;s nothing to lose here, neither for you or the customer. One final pitch before the deal is done if done right, ups your revenue.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>What does the future hold?</strong></h2>\n<p>In the coming years, artificial intelligence and Big Data will be two market drivers that are going to control how recommendations work. After a customer has logged in, big data will come into play along with A.I. to record, interpret and identify a customer&rsquo;s buying pattern. Depending on the customer&rsquo;s behavior, the recommendations will alter.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Looking for a DSLR camera and finding a microscope in the product recommendation, now that doesn&rsquo;t sound like a good recommendation, does it?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>YoKart&rsquo;s recommendation section makes sure you can minimize the anomalies shown in the image above (microscope recommended with a DSLR) and streamline your recommendations easily, without worrying about it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>Dynamic product recommendation has become one of the most useful features of a marketplace admin panel. It gives you the power to speed up your customer through the sales funnel and increase your sales.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As long as artificial intelligence and big data are concerned, technology aficionados and data scientists are working on it and eventually, the ecommerce industry will see a drastic change. But that&rsquo;s not going to happen overnight. Till then, smart algorithms are doing a pretty good job!</p>'),

Isn&rsquo;t that?</p>\n<p>You define your business model and build the online revenue model to prove that the idea will fly. The idea is so good you decided to quit your day job and launched a start-up.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, every other person, howsoever allied with technology, has some kind of desire to launch their own startup. But, when it comes to execution there lies&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yo-kart.com/blog/about-to-start-an-ecommerce-business-know-how-to-overcome-these-common-hurdles-first/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a sea of hurdles along the way of startups</a>. The biggest one being how to market your product or service when you do not have the backing of an angel investor?</p>\n<p>Whatever your idea, no matter how brilliant, you still need a way to tell people about it, but inevitably, initially budget, or rather lack of it will be an issue. The fact of the matter is that if you cater to the consumer sector, then marketing becomes an integral part of your core strategy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To successfully market a startup at low cost, following are the most crucial digital marketing strategies:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The Challenge</h2>\n<p>It is like a fight between David and Goliath. The established players that you are trying to unseat have a substantial reach in their targeted marketplace and huge marketing budgets. You, on the other hand, would have just a handful of people, who already have many aspects of the business to look after. You have to compete with the big players and do marketing on a shoestring budget.</p>\n<p>So what can be the strategy of a bootstrapped startup to compete with the big players in the sector where it is still trying to get a strong foothold?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>How to turn an idea into industry disruption</h2>\n<p>The answer is quite simple, although the implementation is a bit complex. The idea behind this approach is to build an excitement around your startup and leverage upon it. You just cannot walk into the home ground of established players and challenge them for a duel. In fact, you should create an environment where you would have an edge over the competition.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>STEP 1 &ndash; Visualize your digital marketing path and plan of action beforehand</strong></p>\n<p>As already discussed, one should not go all guns blazing at the competition in the eagerness to win the market share. You ought to form a digital marketing plan of action based on the digital marketing radar. This is a widely used strategy, which optimizes the success of digital marketing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-421\" src=\"https://www.yo-kart.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Digital-Marketing-Radar-Chart.png\" alt=\"digital-marketing-radar-chart\" width=\"702\" height=\"702\" loading=\"lazy\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This will help you discover which marketing channels to prioritize in order to manage the time and money. You need to think deep about how to present an idea as exciting. Make sure that you do not present your product or service as a competitor of something.</p>\n<div class=\"cta_box\">\n<div class=\"cta_button\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>STEP 2 &ndash; Build presence across social media platforms</strong></p>\n<p>When it comes to startups, there is no better place to start marketing other than social media. Most of the startups get the initial traction nowadays from social media only.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do ensure that you do not come out sounding like a corporation.</li>\n<li>Keep your social media presence as human as possible.</li>\n<li>Remember- you are on social media not to praise yourself but to engage with your audience.</li>\n<li>Interaction is a great way to gain publicity among users, especially on Twitter. Create separate accounts for support and branding.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Step 3 &ndash; Run a regular newsletter to build an email list</strong></p>\n<p>Once you have gained adequate social media following and your targeted user base starts to pay attention to your product and service, the next step is to create a customer base. Utilize email marketing for this. The fact remains that Email is a channel, which offers best ROI. However, keep in mind that the newsletters that you send are organic opt-ins. This will help your followers know about the current developments and keep them in the loop for all the latest updates.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that sending these newsletters too frequently with the goal of enticing users to buy something can result in more requests to unsubscribe from the list. So make it reasonable and goal-focused.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>STEP 4 &ndash; Invoke excitement to increase your reach with PR campaigns</strong></p>\n<p>Running the whole campaign organically is not always possible. Somewhere down the line, you need to push your digital marketing strategy to a higher gear. Getting a lot of press coverage is always good for a startup, if that coverage is positive. Here you can double the excitement around your brand by creating several PR campaigns. Once you get the ball rolling, you will easily see your reach expanding.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>STEP 5 &ndash; Pump your online reputation with customer reviews</strong></p>\n<p>Every second user reads online customer reviews to determine whether a local business is worth their time and money or not. This is why customer reviews are the biggest driver of public relations for businesses.</p>\n<p>Just imagine what will happen when you bring your business in front of customers, who are ready to spend money. In addition, if you have the best reviews among the competition, you are sure to entice these customers into choosing your brand over and over again.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>STEP 6 &ndash; Reward loyal followers to increase engagement</strong></p>\n<p>While incorporating all these strategies, you have been leveraging upon your loyal customers to increase your reach. They have been promoting your brand, sharing their reviews, which have in turn helped you in your online reputation.</p>\n<p>Once your startup has generated some traction; it is the time to reward the loyal followers with some special offers. This will not only strengthen their loyalty but also attract other users towards your brand.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In order for a startup to succeed, you need determination and a brilliant product to succeed. However, many startups fail to take off despite having both because they are unable to market their product. The above-mentioned points clearly highlight that you need not always require big budget when it comes to digital marketing strategies. You just have to be agile and seek out best advice from professionals who can ensure that your product sees the light of day without putting a big hole in your pocket.</p>'),

Their strategies to deal with the pandemic may serve as a blueprint for small/medium-sized businesses to follow:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>ASOS</strong></h2>\n<p>Amid the pandemic, ASOS &ndash; the online fashion and cosmetics retail giant recorded a 25% drop in sales. It also confirmed&nbsp;nine warehouse workers&nbsp;to be infected with COVID-19. In a bid to survive this unprecedented crisis, the retailer has adopted the following changes:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>ASOS paused all deliveries and incoming shipments from suppliers as well as third-party brands to make time for adjustments and manage stock. The retailer continues to serve its customer deliveries as usual offering an additional 10% discount through its mobile app to lure customers.</li>\n<li>The retailer ended the agreement early with all employees on fixed-term contracts citing the coronavirus crisis.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>ASOS tested the augmented reality (AR) technology via its See My Fit service at the start of this year to simulate real-life model photography. The tool allowed shoppers to check how their clothing selection will look on different body types.

Hit by the pandemic and lockdown restrictions, Drizzly has partnered with retailers to promote healthy delivery practices across its network. Here is how Drizzly is lending support and keeping the community safe while ensuring smooth operations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>For legal and safety reasons, deliveries must be made in-person to a corporate/residential address. Drizzly encourages both customers and the driver to designate a delivery spot outside the house/building.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>While ID scanning is still mandatory before delivery, Drizzly is encouraging drivers for contactless scanning (i.e. a customer will simply hold the ID for a driver to scan).</li>\n<li>Working with retail partners to forego the need to sign a driver&rsquo;s device during delivery.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These are a few changes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drizly.com/covid-19/e-d57e3ce3bb257bd2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Drizzly</a>&nbsp;is implementing to ensure safe and hassle-free alcohol deliveries amid the pandemic. While the delivery demand is accelerating with each day, Drizzly urges consumers to politely avoid direct hand contact with drivers and tip generously.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Nykaa</strong></h2>\n<p>An omnichannel lifestyle retailer Nykaa turned eight in May amid the pandemic. While the physical stores were shut, the retailer quickly converted its website to sell only essentials and in turn recorded a turnover of around 10-15% at the start. Its operational strategy during the pandemic includes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Amid lockdown restrictions in March, Nykaa started taking pre-paid orders only for hand sanitizers, napkins, personal hygiene products, and other essentials albeit with longer delivery timelines.</li>\n<li>Being an inventory-led retailer Nykaa had large amounts of inventory available in the physical stores shut amid the pandemic. These stores became mini-warehouses as Nykaa smartly began operating hyperlocal deliveries for essential products ( but only from the stores). It took orders by phone as well and helped bring down the supply chain cost to a great extent.</li>\n<li>Considering the capacity constraints in the warehouse, Nykaa wasn&rsquo;t accepting orders below&nbsp;₹&nbsp;1500 (or $19.91). This pushed the average order value up by 30-40%.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>According to the founder and CEO Falguni Nayar, being an omnichannel retailer helped&nbsp;<a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/being-an-omni-channel-retailer-helped-us-during-the-covid-19-crisis-nykaas-falguni-nayar/articleshow/76456397.cms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nykaa</a>&nbsp;sail through the COVID-19 crisis.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>UBER</strong></h2>\n<p>From offering healthcare workers&nbsp;free rides and meals&nbsp;to making masks mandatory for riders &amp; drivers, the ride-hailing marketplace giant is doing everything in its power to scale operations and survive the darkest hours. These are the key things Uber has implemented to commit to safety guidelines:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Uber now uses facial recognition tech to determine if drivers are wearing masks. So, before starting a ride, uber drivers must take a selfie and submit it within the app for verification. Even for riders, the use of face-scanning technology is being considered by Uber.</li>\n<li>Drivers must verify they are sanitizing the vehicle every day and riders&nbsp;are prompted not to sit in the front seat of a vehicle.</li>\n<li>Both&nbsp;drivers and riders&nbsp;must abide&nbsp;by the new COVID-19 safety guidelines i.e. regularly wash or sanitize hands and confirm they do not have COVID-19 or any related symptoms.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While people are still adapting to social distancing, in areas where new cases of coronavirus are declining more people are booking Uber to visit a friend&rsquo;s house (for drinks) instead of a bar/pub on a Saturday night.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Best Buy</strong></h2>\n<p>Best Buy &ndash; the consumer electronics giant marketplace reopened its stores in May with in-store consultation for customers available by appointments at 200 locations. With its one-on-one service, the retail giant ensured only a limited number of customers could be inside the store at one time maintaining the social distancing measures norms. Best Buy&rsquo;s reopening strategy includes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A dedicated sales associate will greet customers at the door and items/surfaces will be cleaned during the sales process.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Staff must wear gloves/masks and sanitize the store area before and after every appointment. Also, an employee app is available for self health-checks daily.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Sneeze guards at checkout stations, credit card terminals wiped before/after every transaction, and many more changes to the day-to-day approach as Best Buy reopens its stores.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Last month, Best Buy announced no appointments mandatory for customers in a bid to invite more shoppers to the store. Although, contactless curbside pickup and in-store consultation were still available for the consumers who prefer to shop that way. With new strategies in place, Best Buy stores can now have up to 25% of capacity with floor signage to ensure customers and employees maintain 6 feet distance at all times. Its focus on safety amid the pandemic is evident from the&nbsp;approach.</p>\n<p>On the fourth of July weekend sale, the online marketplace giant offered 40% off on kitchen appliances plus a $200 gift card to customers. With such lucrative deals and safety norms (at retail stores) Best Buy is doing its best to attract more consumers and return to normalcy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Airbnb</strong></h2>\n<p>As lockdown restrictions start to ease, holiday lovers are looking to explore the countryside or small beach towns nearby. Airbnb &ndash; the vacation rental online marketplace is gearing up to resume operations and prepare for the future of travel with enhanced cleaning initiative. It has developed the new standardized protocol for cleaning and sanitization in the home-sharing industry under the guidance of Dr. Vivek Murthy (former US Surgeon) and other experts in hospitality and medical hygiene.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Airbnb&rsquo;s new cleaning guidelines state:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Learning and certification program to empower the host community. Also, specific information on COVID-19 prevention such as the use of personal protective equipment or disinfectants approved by regulatory authorities will be shared.</li>\n<li>As hosts enroll for the program, guests can quickly identify and book accommodations accordingly.</li>\n<li>As per the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendation, a 24-hour waiting period is essential before entering the rental space.</li>\n<li>Also, if hosts are unable to commit to the cleaning protocol, they can opt for a vacancy period called Booking Buffer. Here, reservations are blocked for a time frame (currently set at 72 hours).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Amid COVID-19 concerns, more people are drawn to activities that involve less crowd exposure, but more assurance of cleanliness. Airbnb with its new cleaning protocols and standardized guidelines is offering travelers more control over the surroundings and travel experience.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Netflix</strong></h2>\n<p>With a record 16 million new paid subscribers, Netflix registered an unprecedented growth in the first quarter of 2020.

The only visible impact of the pandemic as quoted by Netflix is &ldquo;less cash spending this year as some content projects are pushed out.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Netflix decided to cut its bit rate by 25%, streaming videos only in standard definition across Europe, as requested by the EU commissioner. This is the company&rsquo;s statement:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><em>&ldquo;Following the discussions between Commissioner Thierry Breton and [Netflix chief executive] Reed Hastings, and given the extraordinary challenges raised by the coronavirus, Netflix has decided to begin reducing bit rates across all our streams in Europe for 30 days,&rdquo; the company said.</em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51968302\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BBC</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />As lockdown restrictions ease and home refinement end, Netflix is slowly ending this restriction on video quality. Although, a dominant player in streaming space, Netflix expects viewing and membership growth to decelerate in the days ahead. Still, it is one of the top contributors making home confinement a little more bearable.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Upwork</strong></h2>\n<p>The top freelancing marketplace that unites talent from over 180 countries, Upwork registered nearly 50% increase in freelancer signups since the pandemic began. With a third of all Fortune 500 companies such as Microsoft using the platform, client spending has become stable on Upwork.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To cope with the uncertainty surrounding pandemic, Upwork is offering a variety of resources to businesses and freelancers as listed below:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A $1 million grant program to support businesses working directly towards mitigating coronavirus impact on communities and economies.</li>\n<li>Partnered with Veem &ndash; global payments platform to enable American clients and talents to apply for the SBA paycheck protection program.</li>\n<li>With the announcement of faster payouts, Upwork has cut the payment wait time in half for top-rated freelancers and agencies.</li>\n<li>Specific COVID-19 jobs feed connecting companies with key projects (including critical coronavirus initiatives) to skilled remote workers.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.upwork.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047407314-Upwork-and-COVID-19\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Upwork</a>&nbsp;is helping millions of freelancers across the globe connect with top enterprises and earn steady income even during the pandemic. Their support is truly helpful.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Steam</strong></h2>\n<p>A prominent online gaming marketplace, Steam enables users to join groups, chat in-games, and do more. Initially started as a digital content distribution channel by Valve, Steam soon grew to a leading platform for thousands of creators/publishers to sell games online and establish a direct relationship with the community. Steam currently has a library of nearly 30k games with exclusive deals and automatic game updates available for users.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Valve (the company behind Steam) has initiated a few changes to Steam:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>With Steam setting new records for concurrent players amid lockdowns, Valve confirms only games played within the last three days will be updated immediately.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>To reduce bandwidth usage, Valve encourages gamers to uncheck automatic updates for games they have in the library but no longer play. Also, they can self-throttle their connection to steam and ease the load on the network.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Amid stay-at-home orders, Steam registered a new record of nearly 22 million players logging in to play on Monday afternoon. As the coronavirus threat looms larger it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise us if people chose to stay at Steam for a bit longer even as lockdown restrictions ease.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Amazon</strong></h2>\n<p>While growing at a steep rate Amazon hasn&rsquo;t been immune to the COVID-19 crisis. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky stated that India&rsquo;s lockdown restrictions due to coronavirus have been the biggest impact on its international business operations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><em>&ldquo;I think the biggest impact internationally has been in India where, of course, similar to all companies in India, we&rsquo;re now only fulfilling our essential goods such as grocery, so that&rsquo;s cut back a lot on our offering,&rdquo; Brian T Olsavsky, senior vice president and chief financial officer of Amazon saying during an earnings call.</em><br /><br />Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.firstpost.com/tech/news-analysis/coronavirus-outbreak-amazon-says-india-business-most-affected-due-to-the-covid-19-lockdown-8321841.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FirstPost<br /></a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />The eCommerce marketplace giant incurred over $600 million COVID-19 related costs in the first quarter globally. This includes the procurement cost of personal protective equipment (PPE), enhanced cleaning facilities cost, and the drop in productivity due to social distancing measures implemented. Amazon expects this cost to cross $4 billion in the second quarter.</p>\n<p>As lockdown restrictions ease and the Indian government allows non-essential items sale on eCommerce platforms, Amazon has announced several measures to empower small-medium businesses and sellers on the marketplace. It&rsquo;s COVID-19 response is adequate as listed below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Amazon has waived off nearly half of the &ldquo;Selling on Amazon (SoA)&rdquo; fees or referral fee till June 30. Also, the storage fee for all products at its fulfillment center was suspended till April 30.</li>\n<li>From food/groceries to healthcare items, the retail giant prioritized delivering high-priority products and canceled orders containing lower priority items. Moreover, to reduce the impact of these cancellations on seller partners, Amazon is refunding all fulfillment and referral fees.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With an operating loss of $398 million in Quarter 1 as compared to $90 million last year, the pandemic has largely affected the eCommerce giant. But, Amazon with its wider policies is expected to grow and surpass this obstacle as the world eases lockdown restrictions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>COVID-19 pandemic will push the global economy into the worst recession since world war II, according to a press release by&nbsp;The World Bank. As brands counter the global pandemic, necessary steps taken will help them survive the crisis and return to normalcy at the earliest</p>'),

With the Amazon Prime membership in place, the company is looking to attract more customers in the future. In addition, in late 2017, Amazon announced the launch of its AWS Data Center in Bahrain as part of its market expansion plan for the region.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Noon.com was launched in October 2017 as a regional rival to Amazon. The US$1 billion eCommerce platform based out of Saudi Arabia was founded by Mohamed Alabbar, Chairman of Emaar. Similar to Amazon, a tech fund led by Mohamed Alabbar acquired UAE-based JadoPado.com in May 2017 prior to the launch of Noon.com.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other notable eCommerce players include Namshi.com, eBay, Ali Express, Nahel.com, Ubuy.com, Aido.com, Awok.com, Mumzworld.com, and the number is only expected to grow. Moreover, traditional retail chains are on their way to transitioning to the eCommerce model to serve both online and traditional customers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Why is Consumer&rsquo;s Interest Shifting From Traditional to eCommerce?</strong></h2>\n<p>In the current scenario, the shift is happening due to Coronavirus and the level of its contagiousness which is making the consumers not visit crowded places. But even before the pandemic hit the world, middle east consumers were widely popular as they have seen tremendous growth in internet connectivity in recent years. Let us understand the reasons why there is a huge potential in the eCommerce sector in UAE:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Growth of eCommerce in Middle-East</strong></h3>\n<p>Though eCommerce was introduced in different phases according to the technological advancement in different countries. UAE has managed to position itself as one of the fastest adopters of eCommerce. One of the biggest reasons for the growth is internet usage and smartphone penetration. Here are some of the stats from Statista which will prove the exponential growth of eCommerce in the middle east.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In UAE the revenue in the eCommerce sector is predicted to reach the US $5,746 million in 2020.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The annual growth rate of the revenue in the Middle East (CAGR 2020 -2024) is 16.3% thus resulting in a market volume of US $10,504 million by 2024.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The User penetration is expected to reach 68% by 2024 and the Average revenue per user is expected to be the US $856.79.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img class=\"grey-border aligncenter wp-image-3520 size-full\" src=\"https://www.yo-kart.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Covid19-Forcast.png\" alt=\"Covid19 Forcast\" width=\"862\" height=\"394\" loading=\"lazy\" />Source: Statista</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Mobile Commerce Penetration</strong></h3>\n<p>According to a research by visa, the mobile penetration in UAE is at its record high i.e. 210%. To provide an omnichannel experience to the customers, businesses have started launching their eCommerce business on mobile. There are a number of reasons why mobile commerce has been picking up trends in this country, some of which are secure payments, age of target audience, user experience, and increased security.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Understanding the needs of the consumers and current scenarios, UAE Government is always on the forefront of initiatives which support startups and SMBs who are planning to launch eCommerce business.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dubai Economy Solution has launched a new eCommerce platform for small and medium business retailers to sell their products online during the pandemic.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>UAE&rsquo;s continuous and rapid expansion of startups has attracted global eCommerce giants as Venture capitalists and increased merger and acquisition activities. Recently Souq.com was also acquired by Amazon.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The Government also puts emphasis on a cashless economy and transparent transactions thus boosting the eCommerce in UAE.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Trends Governing the eCommerce Sector&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<p>Popular brands adopting Localization &ndash; Language and localization is a very important aspect when it comes to a brand setting up their online marketplace especially in the Middle East. The popular language used in this country is Arabic, businesses avoid translating the website due to the RTL writing system. Amazon recently launched its website in Arabic to capture the audience of the Middle East. Make sure that the ready-made solution that you choose is multi-lingual and supports RTL writing system.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Social Media and Demographics of the Country &ndash; The population is highly influenced by Social Media trends and activities. Channels like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have a strong role in the buying behaviour of the consumers. Ecommerce players should understand that the demographic of the Middle East is Young tech-savvy consumers and should leverage the social media accordingly.</p>\n<p>Security and Transparency &ndash; UAE government and economic institutions have been pressing on this issue of security for online transactions to make eCommerce secure for end consumers. Banks and 3rd party payment gateways are together strategizing to make the payment secure by adding an additional layer of security before the transaction is processed. Even retailers are now partnering with 3rd party payment gateways to adapt the mandatory protocols.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Logistics and product procurement &ndash; An advantage for entrepreneurs who are planning to launch their eCommerce website in UAE, the logistics and storage cost in UAE is less whereas the infrastructure is of superior quality. Also, UAE is a major trans-shipment destination i.e the port of Jebel Ali and Dubai International Airport which is ranked as&nbsp;the 6th busiest cargo airport in the world thus making product procurement and import easy.</p>\n<p>Technological Advancement &ndash; Just like the whole globe, UAE will also soon be adopting different types of technology to make the user experience seamless and provide automation in supply chain management. Technologies like Omnichannel retailing, Big data, Artificial Intelligence, Augmented reality, chatbots, same-day delivery, cashless transactions have all reached their nascent stage and will soon become prominent in every sector.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>The eCommerce sector in UAE is in its primitive stage and has picked up pace due to the outbreak of coronavirus. Even after the pandemic is over, people will resort to eCommerce marketplace websites for their everyday needs. To launch a marketplace that is accepted widely by users in a specific region you have to choose the perfect marketplace solution.

As both retailers and consumers prefer such an environment, investing in a social marketplace can be a great business idea with potential growth opportunities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Prominent Types Of Social Commerce Marketplace&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>There are several unique social commerce marketplaces gaining traction globally. Let&rsquo;s take a look at some of the most prominent types of social marketplaces here:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Influencer Marketing Platform</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Connecting brands and agencies to content creators on YouTube and other new social media channels, influencer marketing platforms enable branded content to reach the targeted audience. Famebit (now renamed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2020/06/youtube-has-updated-its-famebit-influencer-marketing-platform-and-renamed-it-brandconnect.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BrandConnect</a>), for instance, is a popular example of such platforms that allow influencers to find paid sponsorships with ease. Other similar examples include Grapevine and Reelio.&nbsp;<br />With the YouTube community ever-growing and new channels emerging rapidly, businesses are always on the lookout for popular creators to endorse their brand to reach an already engaged audience. In 2018, the global influencer marketing platform market was evaluated at nearly $137 million. And, with the current growth rate, the market is expected to surpass $370 million by 2027, according to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1036560/global-influencer-marketing-platform-market-size/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Statista</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img class=\"grey-border aligncenter wp-image-3451 size-full\" src=\"https://www.yo-kart.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Social-commerce-market-size.png\" alt=\"Social commerce market size\" width=\"768\" height=\"494\" loading=\"lazy\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Strict lockdowns and quarantine orders amid the pandemic have resulted in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alistdaily.com/social/coronavirus-social-media-increase/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sharp increase in social media consumption</a>&nbsp;globally. As users spend more time on social media channels, investing in an influencer marketing platform can be a great business idea with long-term benefits.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Marketplace For Used/Second-Hand Items</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Online communities with human interaction fostering a personal connection are reshaping today&rsquo;s retail landscape. With seamless, trusted transactions in a dynamic ecosystem, the social commerce marketplace is driving high engagement globally. From Vinted to Poshmark, there are several popular social commerce marketplaces to sell, buy, or swap used clothes and accessories with ease.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Through resale and social shopping at scale, brands like Poshmark are creating a more sustainable future for retailers and consumers alike. According to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.report.poshmark.com/\">Poshmark&rsquo;s 2020 social commerce report</a>, nearly 58% of consumers are more comfortable purchasing an item directly from a social media platform instead of the company&rsquo;s website. Moreover, around 76% of all Poshmark users consider the resale value of an item before purchase, showcasing their love for resale.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In a social commerce marketplace, anyone can be a retailer, influencer, or a brand. With secondhand items dominating the shopper&rsquo;s closet (as shown below), the social commerce marketplace has become the go-to destination to sell/buy used clothes and accessories.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img class=\"grey-border aligncenter wp-image-3453 size-full\" src=\"https://www.yo-kart.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Poshmark-shoppers-stats.png\" alt=\"Poshmark shoppers stats\" width=\"499\" height=\"792\" loading=\"lazy\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fashion Marketplace</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The social commerce marketplace for the online fashion industry is another prominent category with greater potential. While retail giants like Amazon have consistently struggled to crack the fashion industry, social media platforms like Facebook have flirted with a buy button with limited success. This is because they either added the element of social or element of commerce only as an afterthought. Personal connection and discovery &ndash; the two prominent aspects of fashion and lifestyle were missing altogether.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Success in a social commerce marketplace requires new thinking and to become a top consideration in the online fashion and lifestyle industry, a powerful community-driven social commerce marketplace is essential. Amid COVID-19, as the use of digital platforms accelerate, it is believed that the opportunities thus created will persevere albeit companies are ready to embrace innovation.</p>\n<p>With marketplaces like Poshmark connecting millions of people to sell/buy items or the introduction of Instagram Shops, the fashion marketplace is slowly but steadily changing for good.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Going Dutch Marketplace</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going_Dutch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Going Dutch</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a term that predominantly indicates an individual participating in a paid activity covers his/her own expenses. A common phrase used in Europe and other Western countries, Going dutch enables users to crowdfund experiences. It is an excellent marketplace idea rightly adopted by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://letsdutch.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Let&rsquo;s Dutch</a>&nbsp;with &ldquo;Share the fun, split the cost&rdquo; tagline.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The marketplace allows you to either host an experience or search/join an experience as a guest. Hosting an experience generally includes listing the event or service you are offering and the cost per person for the particular experience. For guests, they can search for the desired experiences, explore available spaces, and send a request for space. The host can either accept or decline requests as he/she fits best. It is truly transparent and enables the guest to view/communicate with the host as well as everyone attending before they book. Social marketplaces like these are springing into action connecting strangers together with affordable experiences for all.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Second-Opinion Marketplace</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ladies love a second-opinion on &ldquo;how they look&rdquo; or &ldquo;if the dress is okay with the occasion&rdquo; or &ldquo;what should work best with the particular top.&rdquo; Often they have plenty of choices but no one to ask for advice. With this idea in mind, a new social marketplace is born that allows users to share their picture (or series of pictures) and ask the trusted community a series of questions to get an insight. Such marketplaces establish transparent communication between users, brands and the community.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Go Try It On</strong>, now defunct, followed a similar business model with its smartphone application. It allowed users to upload pictures of themselves in an outfit and get opinions of their friends, families or trusted community members in real-time. As marketplaces like these gain traction, it is the right time to invest.</p>\n<div class=\"cta_box\">\n<div class=\"cta_button\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<h2><strong>Factors responsible for the steady growth of the social marketplace</strong></h2>\n<p>Combining social media features to an eCommerce marketplace is a perfect recipe to drive users in large numbers. But there are several key factors that are crucial for steady marketplace growth. Let&rsquo;s discuss a few here:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Community&nbsp;</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Social commerce marketplaces usually have a large open community of regular buyers actively engaged on the platform with sellers and other buyers. As brands push for better engagement with consumers and stronger online presence, the social commerce marketplace is the perfect platform to grow. It enables businesses to truly engage, interact, and reply to the consumer queries building a stronger bond.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Direct open communication with consumers is the biggest benefit a social commerce marketplace provides to an e-business.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Economical</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unlike traditional eCommerce, the social commerce marketplace enables users to buy, sell, or swap used clothes and accessories online. People can resell items from their closet (like on Poshmark) and buyers can get the desired items at a relatively less price. The economically feasible marketplace combined with an actively engaged community offers steady growth.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>User-Generated Content</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nearly 90% of shoppers believe that UGC influences their buying decision, while around 63% of shoppers consider that UGC creates a more authentic shopping experience. Strengthening the social commerce marketplace, UGC is an effective tool to sell and resell items for users and brands alike. Shoppers today are more sophisticated and marketers need to offer more than just discounts or free shipping to attract customers. The social commerce marketplace with its diverse open community and UGC allows better promotion and opportunities for growth.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Social Experience&nbsp;</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Social elements like private messaging, newsfeed section, chatting, comment, and more in a marketplace create an engaging network for users and brands. For instance, Poshmark with its real-time social shopping experience allows users to buy, sell, or swap used clothes at the comfort of their home. The social experience enables people to easily connect and shop from the closets of other fashion lovers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Specific Features &amp; Functionality of a social commerce Marketplace</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Seller-Friendly Solution</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>A reliable social marketplace offers a simplified seller registration process, large product inventory, personalized store domain, and the ability to manage banner image, product, and information displayed on the shop page. These seller-friendly solutions are ideal and necessary for a social commerce marketplace to become successful.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Banner Advertisements</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another substantial feature to promote and improve visibility for a seller. Banner advertisements empower sellers to market their products more effectively and increase sales in the marketplace. With homepage banners and additional spaces for the seller to run paid campaigns, banner advertisements prove to be an invaluable asset for steady marketplace growth.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Intuitive Product Pages</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Complex functionality combined with weakly designed pages spells disaster for a social commerce marketplace. An engaging community-driven network does not need that. Here, the majority of sellers are not brands/agencies reselling items from their closet. They need an intuitive product page that is easy to understand and use. Vinted, for instance, is a prime example of social commerce marketplaces with intuitive product pages for sellers to list items and sell with ease.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Robust Search&nbsp;</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The social commerce marketplace with robust search functionality enables buyers to find the desired items within milli-seconds. For instance, Elastic Search &ndash; a document-oriented database designed to store and retrieve structured/unstructured data fetches required search query within 10 ms. The social commerce marketplace pre-integrated with Elastic Search provides robust search functionality.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Multiple Payment Options&nbsp;</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another crucial feature for a social commerce marketplace to survive and thrive is the availability of multiple payment options like debit/credit cards, payment gateways, e-wallets, cash-on-delivery, and more. From Amazon to Poshmark, all successful marketplaces accept multiple payment methods to enable users to pay from their preferred mode of payment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Multi-Store Functionality&nbsp;</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unlike social media platforms, the primary objective of a social commerce marketplace is to sell products and generate more revenue. This is possible only with a multi-vendor or multi-store functionality. Social commerce marketplaces enable sellers or brands to manage their own individual shops while the admin can focus on marketplace growth. This is a key feature to run a successful marketplace.</p>\n<div class=\"cta_box\">\n<div class=\"cta_title\">\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cta_button\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p>Starting a social commerce marketplace like Poshmark or Vinted can be a bit challenging and overwhelming without an expert solution. Choose Yo!Kart &ndash; a robust multi-vendor eCommerce platform to start a social commerce marketplace without hassle.

(23, 'People are changing what they are buying, how they are buying, and what they are buying during the COVID-19.', '<p>Until last month, we could have predicted how this pandemic is going to cradle up our life ultimately. Now globally, leaders will all agree that the implication of that effect will stay that will last for at least a decade.</p>\n<p>The numbers are increasing rapidly, and so are the rules for people gathering in public places. Businesses like restaurants, bars, shopping malls are on the verge of shutting down as people maintain social distance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To say that we are living in unprecedented times feels like an understatement.</p>\n<p>One very particular trend that marketers have seen in recent times is how isolation and uncertainty have had a significant impact on the shopping behaviour of people around the globe.

For instance, if you want to test the market and still avoid spending too much, try an ecommerce platform like YoKart. Other examples include CS-Cart &amp; Magento.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Know your Competitors and Customers</h2>\n<p>Now that you have given a thought to the ecommerce website, the next step involves knowing your competitors and customers. While doing so, you can start by conducting a keyword based search on Google or any other search engine.</p>\n<p>For example, suppose you want to start an ecommerce business in New York and want to sell luxury designer clothing for women. Then you can start by searching &ldquo;Luxury clothing for women in New York&rdquo; and analyse other ecommerce websites.</p>\n<p>Doing so, will help you build strategies to face competitors head on.</p>\n<p>For the next phase, you can analyse their product reviews and social media followers to see what people are saying about their service/product.

Localization is one of those key factors that can make or break an ecommerce business.</p>\n<p>One great example of this is the toy powerhouse &ndash; Mattel. In its initial days, the launch of Barbie in China was unsuccessful. A lot of research went in studying local audience to analyse where the company went wrong.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Offer the right price</h2>\n<p>After you know your customers and competitors, it&rsquo;s time that you start offering products on your ecommerce website at prices tuned for your target audience.

Also, having a similar name depends on the availability of domain name. Experts advise business owners to purchase the domain name as soon as they start a business to be on the safe side.</p>\n<p>For marketers, choosing a name that is short, engaging, easy to remember, and in accordance to your business name is a daunting task. Given the number of names that have been already registered online, things seem to get even more difficult for new and upcoming online entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p>A global leader in domain names and internet security recently announced that approximately 1.3 million domain name registrations were added to the internet in the second quarter of 2017. The total number of domain name registrations has reached approximately 331.9 million across all top-level domains. These numbers depict that the amount of competition an entrepreneur is going to face while finding the perfect name for the business.</p>\n<p>Below, in the post, we have explained the techniques e-commerce businesses can use to determine the right domain name for their website. We have also included some tips that an entrepreneur must keep in mind while deciding the domain name. Go ahead and explore the post.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Type of Brand names</strong></h2>\n<h3>Descriptive names</h3>\n<p>The oldest and the most used form of domain names are descriptive names. Entrepreneurs prefer to keep these names because it describes the company efficiently.</p>\n<p>Brands that use a descriptive name portray the niche of the brand and make it easier for the consumer to identify the product/ service.</p>\n<p>One shortcoming of the descriptive name is that the website might start with a specific niche and eventually grow into other products, leading to confusion. So,entrepreneurs must ensure that they keep a general yet descriptive name.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Acronyms names</h3>\n<p>Many firms have been using acronyms as their brand name.This makes it easier for them to choose a domain name. Acronyms are favored because they are small and easy to remember.</p>\n<p>Acronyms usually evolve from service a business provides. Descriptive names can be shortened if there is a need for acronym based domain name.</p>\n<p>For example, a business named National Realty Investment Advisors; people would not want to type the whole thing to reach the website. So, if they name their domain as NRIA, it becomes easier for the users to reach the website instantly.</p>\n<p>Acronym based domain names are quick to absorb, read, remember and easier to buy.But they have one shortcoming: acronyms lose the core meaning. Most people do not know the full form of most abbreviations, so it is better to keep your domain name as acronyms, but you complete business name on the website.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Invented name</h3>\n<p>Some of the most powerful and iconic brands have invented their own domain name, key examples being Google, Kodak and Xerox. Invented names are words that have no real meaning but are created to represent the brand.</p>\n<p>The reason why invented names are most popular because it does not have a meaning for which it has to stand, it is basically empty words which only represent a brand.</p>\n<p>Invented words for a domain name can be a tricky business as not all invented words can have an impact. Like when you hear the word Google, only one thing comes to mind that is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yo-kart.com/blog/key-search-feature-elements-to-ensure-higher-conversion-for-your-ecommerce-store/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">search engine</a>&nbsp;where you can find almost everything. Think Kodak and capturing moments in pictures come to mind immediately. When we think of these words they often come across as a sound or a poetically constructed name.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Tips to choose a domain name</strong></h2>\n<h3>Keep it short and simple</h3>\n<p>If you want your visitors to remember your website, you must ensure that the domain name is short and simple. When they remember your domain name, they will just open their web browser type in your name and press Ctrl + Enter.</p>\n<h3>Understand the psychology</h3>\n<p>There is a connotation in every word of every language that makes our brain associated with emotions of some sort. The connection and inference is a tricky business though. If the definition of a word is positive, it doesn&rsquo;t always mean that the word has a positive connotation. So, before choosing the domain name, make sure you have clear idea about how people will perceive it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Check the competitors</h3>\n<p>You will surely check the competitor&rsquo;s domain name and place them in one of the above techniques of naming. But make sure that you do not copy the name or have a similar name. You want to create a brand identity, and it cannot be done with a copied name. Plus, if you have a similar domain name, most customers might end up on your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yo-kart.com/blog/how-competitor-research-can-help-you-build-robust-strategy-for-your-ecommerce-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">competitor&rsquo;s website</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Avoid using person&rsquo;s name</h3>\n<p>The problem with using a person&rsquo;s name is that a person cannot be associated with the brand forever. It does not give a brand image; it usually has the feel of a startup. So, instead of naming your domain name on a person you admire or is your role model,try thinking creatively what else can be done in similar context.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Be creative</h3>\n<p>Often there are times when a name you like for your online business has already been taken. One way around it is to use the related way that sounds like the original word. Some common examples are Digg (dig), Flickr (flicker) etc. This not only gives your business a catchy name, but also gives you a unique identity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Sub Folders rather Sub Domain</h3>\n<p>Subdomain usually looks like this www.aboutus.companyname.com</p>\n<p>Whereas subfolder usually look like www.companyname.com/aboutus</p>\n<p>They may look similar, but Google reads them differently. Sub-Domain is read as an individual page whereas sub-folders are read as part of the original domain name. The latter is a better as Google sees it as building a library of expertise of particular keyword or topic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Easy to type, read and say</h3>\n<p>You want your domain name to be remembered by all the people that visit you once. The word/words used in the domain name should be easy to type, read and say. Easy to type so that people do not have to learn the spelling or misspell your domain name when typing on a web browser. It should be pronounceable as people prefer the ones that are easily read and told to other people.</p>\n<div class=\"cta_button\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"cta_button\">\n<h2><strong>Ready, Get Set, Go</strong></h2>\n<p>By now, I suppose every entrepreneur must have decided a domain name for their ecommerce business. They must have also checked the availability of the domain name and paid for the domain name. If you launch your e-commerce website with a turnkey solution like YoKart, then you get an option to choose the domain name from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fatbit.com/fab/fatbit-partners-with-radix-fzc/\">.store domains an emerging domain register</a>.</p>\n<p>You have completed the pre-production steps and are ready to set your foot in the production and post-production work of building an ecommerce website.</p>\n</div>');

Here are some strategies to keep in mind when designing a social media post for ecommerce websites.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>User-generated content</strong></h2>\n<p>User-generated content and social media marketing always go hand in hand. When you create a profile on social media you are getting easy access to audiences. It is very important to remember that you will not be able to market your brand single-handedly. Users will contribute their opinion on what you are doing, their complaints and how much they like the products that you sell.</p>\n<p>When you share user-generated content on your social media channel it makes your business more credible, as other people are vouching for your brand. It is better that your existing customers give thumbs up to potential customers rather than you singing your own praise.</p>\n<p>Using user-generated content usually leaves an impact that your existing customer value what your business offers. Anyway, sharing content is far less challenging than writing social media post, both being important to engage the audience on social media.</p>\n<p>Snackible, an e-commerce website that sells healthy snacks have optimally leveraged user-generated content on their twitter handle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1437 alignleft\" src=\"https://www.yo-kart.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Snackible.png\" alt=\"Snackible\" width=\"588\" height=\"610\" loading=\"lazy\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Visual Content</strong></h2>\n<p>When an ecommerce marketplace wants their social media posts to have maximum effect on the audience they need to plan it accordingly. Visual content has become an important aspect of a marketer&rsquo;s social media strategy. The interest of consumers is growing for visual content as evidenced by popular social media platforms like Instagram, Snapchat, and Pinterest.</p>\n<p>Just clicking a picture of your product and posting it on social media will not entice the audience to visit the website. Instead, craft your image/video in a way that it sparks a conversation with the viewer.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There are different ways a product can be displayed on social media: &ndash; Image/video of product creation, creative pictures of the product, graphical planning of the product etc.</p>\n<p>Note: &ndash; It is important to keep in mind the allowed dimensions of visual content by social media platform as you do not want the image/video&rsquo;s frame to be trimmed or distorted.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img class=\"grey-border alignnone wp-image-1438 size-full\" src=\"https://www.yo-kart.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Visual-Content.png\" alt=\"Visual Content\" width=\"443\" height=\"615\" loading=\"lazy\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Recent event</strong></h2>\n<p>Social media has become a major source to gather latest news and people often rely on few platforms for any news updates. People also use social media platforms to interact with business.

And, the online space, too, has its own horizontal giants dominating the market.

To understand better, let&rsquo;s define both:</p>\n<p><strong>The horizontal marketplace model</strong>&nbsp;caters to the needs of more than one industry in a diversified market. Here, businesses typically output goods or services that are widely used and in-demand to a larger market. For instance, a reseller of office furniture will target all companies that maintain offices and need office furniture. The horizontal market typically applies to the majority of businesses defined by a demographic feature. These markets are usually cooperative and extensive than the vertical markets.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On the other hand,&nbsp;<strong>the vertical marketplace model</strong>&nbsp;caters to a niche market. Here, vendors offer goods and services specific to a single market sector/category with a set targeted audience. For instance, the manufacturers of solar panel technology typically sell to solar contractors/installers (often competing against each other). Vertical marketplaces target only a specific audience in a niche demographic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\">\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<h4><strong>&ldquo;For a healthy eCommerce ecosystem, both horizontal and vertical marketplaces must co-exist.&rdquo;</strong></h4>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2><strong>Vertical Marketplace Model Gaining More Popularity</strong></h2>\n<p>While retail giants like Amazon, Alibaba, and others have dominated the online horizontal marketplace for decades, niche-specific markets were still largely unfazed until recently. Prominent vertical marketplaces have emerged and grown in the last decade or so. Airbnb, for instance, in a short span of time has changed the dynamics for the rental accommodation market or Uber with its ride-sharing services. Their focus is solely on a niche market with a set targeted audience. Unlike horizontal, niche-specific marketplaces have the luxury to centralize their efforts on a particular industry and create customer-centric solutions for a set audience.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is why the vertical marketplace model is gaining more popularity over the horizontal marketplace model. To illustrate more, let&rsquo;s discuss the key reasons below:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>1. Well-defined T</strong><strong>argeted Audience</strong></h3>\n<p>Unlike horizontal marketplaces with a huge customer base to deliver goods/services, vertical marketplaces have a well-defined targeted audience. And, for businesses offering specialized products/services to cater to a set audience, the vertical marketplace model presents an ample opportunity to grow and even dominate with time. Moreover, from a customer&rsquo;s perspective, a specialized niche-specific marketplace simplifies their shopping process.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>ASOS, for instance, is a British online fashion and cosmetic retailer with&nbsp; a well-defined targeted audience. Businesses like ASOS in a niche-specific industry often have more clarity over features and functionalities crucial to their marketplace success.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>2. Minimal Marketing Investment&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<p>Comparatively limited categories in a niche-specific marketplace augur well for a business to strategize and focus. Here, the business doesn&rsquo;t need 100s of sellers to kick-start their multi-vendor store. Initially, only a handful of registered sellers offering a variety of quality products could be enough. This reduces the initial investment in marketing and expenses to a minimum.</p>\n<p>Moreover, a single, centralized advertising effort can be instituted across the board, making vertical marketplaces a preferred choice for planners.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>3. Single/Centralized Policy For All</strong></h3>\n<p>While horizontal marketplaces implement broader policies to cover a wide range of product categories, vertical marketplaces can implement a single/centralized policy for all selling needs. So, instead of investing more time in guiding sellers on maintaining product quality or overall selling, the admin can invest his/her time in marketplace growth and development. Here, the business can easily focus on delivering customer-centric solutions and thrive rather than compete with deep-pocketed players in a horizontal marketplace.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>UNI Diamonds, for instance, is one such marketplace for diamond and trading networks developed by Yo!Kart. With a clear focused strategy on improving the customer experience, vertical marketplaces can effectively register a better retention rate.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>4. Specialization</strong></h3>\n<p>Vertical marketplaces specialize in catering to a particular industry with a specific audience. This specialization augurs well for businesses since it&rsquo;s easy to deliver specialized solutions, better customer support, and clear policies centered around a particular industry. Furthermore, the product/service can be easily perfected when a company is allowed to specialize. It gives them an opportunity to dominate the market.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For a horizontal marketplace, however, the policies cover a wide range of aspects and solutions. eBay, for instance, in spite of its wider marketplace reach isn&rsquo;t a dominant player in many key categories. This is why&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ecommercebytes.com/C/blog/blog.pl?/pl/2020/2/1581450215.html\">eBay</a>&nbsp;is also considering a vertical approach.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>5. Less-intensive Competition</strong></h3>\n<p>In the world of Amazon or Alibaba, new emerging businesses look for breathing space to grow. And, vertical eCommerce marketplaces offer just that. Despite the growth of prominent marketplace giants like Uber, Airbnb, and co, there are still several niche-markets without a dominating leader. So, businesses offering solutions that address the pain points of a niche-specific marketplace can easily become a dominant force in the category. Drizzly, for instance, with its alcohol delivery operations is dominating the online liquor marketplace.</p>\n<p>With less-intensive competition in vertical marketplaces, it is an ideal solution for several businesses and a popular marketplace model to follow.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>While there is equal potential in both horizontal and vertical markets, clearly a niche-specific marketplace model is gaining more popularity recently. And, the primary reason behind this could be less dominance in the vertical eCommerce marketplace. It presents a good investment opportunity for businesses looking to prosper and dominate in a particular segment.</p>\n<p>At Yo!Kart, we strive to deliver robust&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yo-kart.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">eCommerce multi-vendor solutions</a> for both horizontal and vertical marketplaces.

(29, 'Below we have highlighted a few important benefits of an omnichannel selling tool in an eCommerce marketplace', '<p>Selling products/services across different sales channels is termed as multi-channel selling &ndash; a practice typically followed by almost every online vendor. Since the majority of vendors have multiple seller accounts on every other marketplace it is difficult to persuade them to register and sell on a new emerging marketplace. For instance, imagine a vendor with 3 different seller accounts on Amazon, eBay, and Etsy respectively. While juggling between three accounts (on possibly the biggest marketplaces) the vendor faces major challenges like:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uploading product images and changing the data as per marketplace suggestions on individual sales channel each time a new product/service is available</li>\n<li>Maintaining consistent and synchronized inventory when selling on multiple sales channels</li>\n<li>Inefficient order management and out-of-stock orders often due to human error</li>\n<li>Keeping track of different state tax policies and eCommerce marketplace policies.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To enhance the experience of high scale vendors, you need to engage them with features that ensure profitability with ease. Create an environment that reduces the time and efforts invested by the vendor and ensures manageability. Ensuring inventory management across different channels will surely grab the attention of performing vendors when you pitch them to join your marketplace.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Benefits Of A Multi-channel Selling Tool In eCommerce Marketplaces</strong></h2>\n<p>Selling on different online marketplaces can be a bit cumbersome without a single integration tool to manage individual seller accounts. Below we have highlighted a few important benefits of an omnichannel selling tool in an eCommerce marketplace:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>1. Efficient Catalog Management</strong></h3>\n<p>When selling on different marketplaces, each inventory must be individually updated which is a tedious process without an effective tool. An eCommerce marketplace with a multi-channel inventory management system enables vendors to easily upload images, change data (as per individual marketplace suggestions), and list items intended to sell on different marketplaces. Easy catalog management is the primary benefit of using a multi-channel selling tool.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>2. Centralized&nbsp; Dashboard</strong></h3>\n<p>A crucial aspect for seamless multi-channel selling, a centralized dashboard automatically monitors and manages stock levels/sales on multiple marketplaces. It enables vendors to take control of their inventories and make incremental sales strategies across channels. Vendors no longer have to split inventory or block out stock levels for the different sales channels.&nbsp;A centralized dashboard enables an online marketplace owner and its sellers to control operations like restocking or purchase with minimal hassle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>3. Real-time Updates On Inventory</strong></h3>\n<p>According to a survey by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/991914/shopping-cart-abandonment-online-consumer-reasons-united-kingdom-uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Statista</a>&nbsp;in 2018, nearly 27% of online fashion shoppers in the UK abandoned their carts due to out-of-stock items. This is a significant margin that can easily hamper business growth.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img class=\"grey-border aligncenter wp-image-3511 size-full\" src=\"https://www.yo-kart.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Inventory-Stats.png\" alt=\"Inventory Stats\" width=\"722\" height=\"507\" loading=\"lazy\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Consider using an omnichannel selling system that automatically updates inventory levels when any change occurs across all sales channels.&nbsp;With real-time inventory updates, vendors can easily restock items as required and avoid losing customers to their competitors due to out-of-stock items. Also, it prevents sellers from spending too much money on inventory (when the stock levels are sufficient) that could be better utilized elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>4. Order Management Is Easy</strong></h3>\n<p>Simplified order management is another essential benefit of an omnichannel inventory management system. It syncs all sales channels seamlessly in a hyper-connected retail environment while optimizing fulfillment operations.&nbsp;With a user-friendly multi-channel selling marketplace, vendors can quickly view the status of inventory, orders, and shipping operations in real-time. Moreover, it enables speedy delivery operations offering the best-personalized shopping experience to buyers across channels.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Yo!Kart In Partnership With EasyEcom</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://easyecom.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EasyEcom</a>&nbsp;is a comprehensive multi-channel inventory management software that offers advanced features like order fulfillment, reconciliation, warehouse management, and more.
